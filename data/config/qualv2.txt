## FIELDS

### 1. hook_type (categorical)

Classify based on the **first 1-2 sentences** only.

Allowed values: `question`, `claim`, `story`, `challenge`

- **question** — opens by asking the viewer something.
  Example transcript: "Did you know that 90% of startups fail in the first year? Here's what the survivors do differently..."
  Example transcript: "What would you do if you lost everything tomorrow? Most people have no plan..."

- **claim** — opens with a declarative statement, bold assertion, or surprising fact.
  Example transcript: "The number one reason you're not growing is you post at the wrong time. I tested 500 videos and here's what I found..."
  Example transcript: "AI will replace 40% of jobs by 2030. But there are three roles that will actually pay more..."

- **story** — opens with a personal anecdote, narrative setup, or "I did X" framing.
  Example transcript: "Last week I quit my six-figure job and here's why. I was sitting in a meeting when my boss said..."
  Example transcript: "I spent 30 days eating only what I could grow in my backyard. Day one was a disaster..."

- **challenge** — opens by challenging the viewer to do something or daring them.
  Example transcript: "Try this for 7 days and watch what happens to your productivity. Step one, delete social media..."
  Example transcript: "I dare you to wake up at 5 AM for a month. Here's the routine that changed my life..."

**Fallback:** If none fit clearly, choose `claim`.

---

### 2. has_numbers (boolean)

Does the transcript contain **specific numerical values**: percentages, dollar amounts, counts, dates, measurements, or statistics?

- **true**: "I gained 10,000 followers in 30 days" / "Studies show 73% of people..."
- **false**: "I gained a lot of followers quickly" / "Most people struggle with this"

General quantities like "most", "many", "a few" do NOT count. Must be a specific number.

---

### 3. has_examples (boolean)

Does the transcript include **at least one concrete, specific example** — a named product, a described scenario, a step-by-step walkthrough, or a "for instance" illustration?

- **true**: "For example, if you invest $100 in an index fund..." / "Take someone like Elon Musk, he..."
- **false**: "You should invest wisely" / "Successful people do this differently"

Abstract advice without concrete illustration = false.

---

### 4. structure_type (categorical)

How is the body of the transcript organized (after the hook)?

Allowed values: `single_point`, `list`, `narrative`, `comparison`

- **single_point** — one main idea explored in depth, no enumeration.
  Example: "The key to retention is your first three seconds. Here's why: the algorithm measures..."

- **list** — enumerates multiple items, tips, steps, or reasons (often with "first", "second", "number one", etc.).
  Example: "Three things killing your growth. Number one, inconsistent posting. Number two, weak hooks. Number three, no CTA."

- **narrative** — tells a story from beginning to end with chronological progression.
  Example: "So I showed up to the interview and the first thing they asked me was... Then I said... And that's when..."

- **comparison** — explicitly contrasts two or more things (before/after, A vs B, old way vs new way).
  Example: "Most people do X. But top performers do Y instead. Here's the difference..."

**Fallback:** If unclear, choose `single_point`.

---

### 5. has_cta (boolean)

Do the **last 2 sentences** contain an explicit call to action — asking the viewer to follow, like, comment, subscribe, share, save, check a link, or try something specific?

- **true**: "Follow for more tips like this" / "Drop a comment below with your answer" / "Link in bio"
- **false**: Ends with a concluding thought, punchline, or statement without directing the viewer.

Must be an explicit directive to the viewer. Rhetorical questions at the end are NOT a CTA.

---

### 6. specificity_level (categorical)

How concrete and specific are the claims and advice in the transcript overall?

Allowed values: `vague`, `moderate`, `specific`

- **vague** — generic platitudes, no actionable detail.
  Example: "You just need to work harder and believe in yourself."

- **moderate** — some concrete direction but lacks precise numbers, names, or steps.
  Example: "Post consistently and focus on hooks that grab attention in the first few seconds."

- **specific** — includes precise numbers, named tools/methods, step-by-step instructions, or detailed examples.
  Example: "Post 3 reels per day at 8 AM EST using CapCut's auto-caption feature."

**Fallback:** If uncertain, choose `moderate`.

---

### 7. has_social_proof (boolean)

Does the transcript reference **external authority** to support its claims — citing studies, experts, famous people, brands, personal credentials, or verifiable results?

- **true**: "Harvard researchers found..." / "I built a $2M business doing this" / "Warren Buffett says..."
- **false**: "Trust me, this works" / "Everyone knows this is true"

Self-reported results count only if they include specific, verifiable numbers.
