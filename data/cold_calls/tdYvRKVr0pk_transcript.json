  "text": " Today you're going to watch me speed run some cold calling. I'm going to start from square one on an offer I've never sold before all the way until I've collected my first thousand dollars and I'm going to do it all live. I'm literally just going to walk you through my entire process so you can see what it's like in real time to do this and you can see all the software that I'm using so you can replicate this for yourself. After this video you'll have basically no excuse not to close with cold calling because you're literally going to see every single button that I press every word that I say to do it for myself. So let's not waste any time. Let's jump into it. First, we're going to select a business to sell for on the Glen Cocoa platform. We're going to look for a good industry, good payout, lead count, making sure it's not too strict and see if other successes reps are having. Step two, we're going to do some market research and train up on the campaign. The business provides training within the platform. And then if we need to do any extra research, we'll look for soundbites that, you know, generate curiosity, intrigue, status alignment, credibility. We're going to identify any macroeconomic trends, significant market dynamic changes, any relevant statistics. And then we're going to understand the industry terminology and how and when to say those terms in context as if we're an insider. Step three, we're going to create or use the screenplays that are provided. These are the cold call scripts. And step four, we're going to audition for the campaign and get approval, hopefully pretty quickly. And then we'll start cold calling. We'll try to book the meetings. We'll track some of these stats here. And then we'll do the reminder call and warm handoff and then dispute if necessary. And then we should get paid. Pretty simple and straightforward. Okay. This is the Glen Coco marketplace here. And what's nice is businesses will list their product or service on the marketplace. And then sales reps can essentially go in and hunt for these bounties, basically book meetings to hunt for these bounties here. And so one of the ones that I've been eyeballing is Starbridge. Starbridge pays out straight up $1,000 for each qualified meeting. I know this is a pretty hot one on the platform right now. The qualification is not too strict. There's a ton of data. So there's almost 12,000 available leads. Self-sourcing is available as well. I believe this one is in the platform that delivers extra insights for teams selling into state, local, and education. So SLED accounts, it enriches CRM data, enables AI-driven personalization outreach, and accelerates RFP drafting, helping sales leaders streamline outbound processes and generate more qualified leads. So they basically do data for sales teams selling into SLED. Qualification criteria, they have to have at least five salespeople Prospect manages the sales team at their organization with titles like director VP head of go to market sales marketing growth rev ops CRO SDR BDR manager sent a sled and then expresses frustration with their outbound sales process okay great and a bunch of successful pitches here so yeah we're gonna select this one pretty juicy payout and done the leads here so let's get into the training here I'm gonna put a little data sheet together star bridge okay we gotta go quick you're founded 234 AI government tech elevator pitch a power platform that connects businesses with local governments core value prop is to monitor local government education signals okay campaign lunch showcase all right let's see what we got okay so board meeting minutes are listed on you know like town of town of wassusuki okay so like like municipal government government government board meeting minutes okay interesting no other data provider can get website so it's like specific scraping legally all these institutions need to reveal like all of all their information uh through the freedom of information act way of all agencies need to uh port via foia free information what is Is it free? Hold on. Free information. Like all of all of their information. Freedom of information. Freedom of information. Freedom of information. Freedom of information act. That's FOIA. When I'm pitching this, it's like, how do you get all this intent data? Well, basically all agencies need to report via freedom of information act FOIA. We have an AI scraping tool that goes through, you know, board meeting minutes and, you know, their websites plus agency website agency websites doing what most data providers data providers can slash don have access to i don know if they necessarily don have vaccines There's an angle here. Instead of hiring two SDRs at 120K fully loaded, there's an efficiency. You know, three generating out of seven signals. The second piece is just like higher conversion rates across the board. And so, you know, for outbound campaigns, we're seeing anywhere from seven to ten times the conversion rates of a standard campaign. 7 to 10 times reduce headcount spend that's probably one angle and then 7 to 10x conversion rates of typical standard outbound pains okay I wonder if that's in 2025, your prospects are getting blown up in email and calls. So now the only differentiator is to your ability to personalize and craft a message that's hyper relevant to cut through the noise and demand attention. There's probably something in like the attention economy, the attention economy. There might be a riff there. Economy. Okay. Through the noise. I run this podcast that sold cloud deals to enterprises and like his bread and butter is delving into like the 10Ks, right? And that's like issues going to the source for the context data is like a very important thing. And it's easier to do for like corporate entities than it has been for site entities. Because like the corporate entities, they're filing something with like this, like CC file, right? And that's not the same as like these entities where they do, they have to, they have to make all of their stuff available via FOIA requests. But you know, that's not necessarily common knowledge. And even if someone knew it, no one is sitting and filling out for your reply. So I think just the ability to personalize messaging to the SLED segment, it something that you guys bring in a way that just happens Yeah the other thing that I was thinking about is what exciting if I were in your shares as someone who kind of calling into our prospects is that we also using kind of these intent signals to go after them So for your in terms of like paying for your buck in kind of the time that you're spending calling, you know, we're doing this internally and we're seeing, you know, if you compare just like blanket outreach to some random company, maybe you're gonna get one out of 100, two out of 100. We're seeing them convert, you know, four or five, six out of 100. And I think that's because we're leaning into like this information that we have. And so a good example of that is, you know, we're targeting a prospect. we know who their top competitor is and then we can say you know so and so but you're going to five instead of converting instead of converting one to two per 100 contacts we see folks adding four to five Okay, hold on. Aggregate key buying signals. Okay, key buying signals like RFPs, RFPs. Starbridge helps aggregate key buying signals like RFPs, board meeting mentions. Board meeting mentions. Stress. strategic plans, competitor contracts. And this might be in the training later on, but I'm just taking notes because for me, repetition is the key to adult learning. I just like reminding myself over and over and over and over again. And like typing it out helps, helps me kind of remember those things. Expiration dates, contract expiration dates. I think that's contract. The one unified view, making it much simpler to keep track of all these signals. Let's imagine And that's all under a single pane of glass. That's the platform. Oh, whoa, that's kind of cool. I noticed your November board session minutes that you discuss a need for a new ERP system, temporary renewal of the Absorb Enterprise Learning Management System contract. That's actually massive. That's crazy. Okay. Yeah. auto respond to rfps auto respond draft rfps directly in the plant  This is crazy. I'm just going to say budget constraint. Do a one month POC with us. Close one sled deal to prove and we're off to the races. Probably something like that. The first call is probably like, Hey, just want to see if you'd be completely opposed to 15 minute coffee break style chat, just to get a virtual tour of the platform. Show how we're able to draft RFPs, show intent signals, show board minutes, whatever. And then from there, especially I know for a lot of folks here in 2025, it's all about getting scrappy. Budget dollars are tight. If there is even a remote fit, we typically do these one month POCs, where proof of concepts, where we want you to close a sled deal, use our data to close a sled deal, and then see for yourself if it's worth continuing the program. something like that. I mean, is there pricing on here? Features, use cases about, resources, login, book a demo. So there's no pricing on here. That sounds like 30K for the year. So they just need to close one deal in a year. Like Zoom Info, which is like another data provider, they're only like 15 grand a year, but like 30 grand if you're paying for like the top, top package, unless this is like super premium, but there's no way someone's spending 30K a month on data unless they're doing like super volume so you know competitor and they have a handful of different uh you know tools like which one specific are they paying for um and then the last piece is just like ui and like how intuitive it is they're not very good at that and actually the real last piece is like being able to act on it And so for them for the most part it just kind of like this database that people are using I think where we come in and what compelling is that we can take all this information these intent signals and then you can actually generate an email and know who you want to target and have the best contact data so that you actually taking this market intelligence and you're doing something with it versus just having this information that may or may not be helpful. Yeah, that makes a ton of sense. One other piece that's relevant is that there's a handful of newer companies that are coming in because it is this AI gold rush. And so I would say if on these calls, two competitors come up, I would say one, it's nation graph and then two, it's called pursuit nation graph, other competitors, nation graph and pursue. Yeah. these are super right like building interesting models that we can use to act on it and you just wait for the longer time yeah like I'll say is like and everyone else is like exactly yeah yeah yeah it's uh yeah I think um yeah This is pretty similar, it looks like. Generate talking points, generate prospecting email, chat with entity. Oh, that's interesting. All right, I think that's about it. Okay, so let's go product overview. Up on sales. This is a clip from the video. Suite of AI power tools to sign and enhance proposal writing. measurement specifically key product includes rp repository ai power okay users product knowledge base crm enrichment buying signal and outbound tool converts these signals into actual outbound strategies go to market intelligence platform for slide deals offers a platform that integrates group meetings strategic plans yep yep yep snippets opportunities web scraping foia requests Freedom of Information Act. Refer to this website Switch from GoSpend Okay so there like a whole thing here Okay so we come back to that Mark is complete ICP buyer persona Significant part. That's kind of hazy. I mean, number one priority, yes, but significant part. Is that 50%? Is that 20%? So are they going to disqualify it if it's only a quarter of their revenue? Okay, we'll see. Let's see where we're at. Your VP's note, if you come across accountants. Try and get a meeting with their manager. Okay, got it. Paypoint time consuming proposal process, lack of real time insights, difficulty in identifying high intent opportunities, instrument outbound tool. Got it. I'm kind of breezing through this because number one, it's the speed run. I understand conceptually what this is. It's a data broker that has some extra bells and whistles. All right, services in Mongo, of course, dog, Amira, Govwell. Okay, cool. Qualification criteria, sales qualified lead, sales focus. Okay, should be good. This is qualified Lee criteria, selling into state local education, VP manager plus basically pain points, budget, a budget is vague, leveraging AI new technologies, intent data, sells into SLED. Okay, nice. Did I click into this? Did I miss this? The heck? Call script example. Okay, so low energy, poor tonality, like a dog can smell a cat, confident, professional eloquence, be calmly, but also know how to modulate your pitch to sound. excited at times. Okay, thanks. Okay, so we get the talk track here. This is a cool call, but really well researched one. Do you have 20 seconds? Curiosity hook. I'm calling because we see early buying signals in your market that you can act on before an RFP drops. How are you spotting those right now? We're an AI platform that scans every corner of the public sector for early buying signals and build custom agents to track the ones that matter to you most in real time. By the time an RFP drops, it's already too late. We make sure you're in the deal before anyone else knows it exists. Conversation flow if they engage. Ask follow-up questions. We'll layer in value responses. When you uncover a gap or pain, bridge to the close. Public sector strategy session. Okay. Public sector strategy session. 15-minute working session. Your market. Identify the exact signals that matter to your account and outline a plan to break into them. After that, our engineering team can spin up custom AI agents for you and we'll walk into the follow-up call with a live dashboard of accounts and contacts you can go after immediately. That's hot. If they stall or shorten on time. Mm Discovery questions How are you prioritizing public sector accounts today We help teams focus on a small percent of accounts showing early buying signals Okay Do you have ways of way to identify in-market accounts before RFPs are released? Wait on formal bids. So a lot of teams, you know, wait on formal bids. We actually help them get ahead and shape deals before they hit the open market. So your team doing much outbound, mostly inbound and RFP response. How much of your team's time goes into research versus actual outreach? Has your team ever been surprised by a competitor winning a deal before you even knew it was live? Okay. Do you feel confident you know where public sector budgets are going before they're announced? Checks. Funding flows, public meetings, and grant trails. Interesting grant trails. Funding flows, public meetings, grant trails. Okay. By repositioning the strategy session is low commitment, high value. Do I understand here. Okay, well, it just said if it's in a low level SDR, don't book it. So book with the manager. Okay, bull does we already use a provider if pursue teams are often teams often replace pursuit because they want deeper buying signals like competitor contract expirations like meeting monitoring. If it's govspend team switch from govspend for more actionable data, verify contacts expiration tracking. Okay, we have enough leads two to 5% showing intent plan engage in this strategy session. Nice. Already tracks some agents to automate the parts that you have your time. GovSend's great. GovSpend, that makes total sense. GovSend's great. I guess GovSpend pops up a lot. It's great at surfacing historical spend and showing what agencies have bought in the past. Where Starbridge really comes in is it's all about outbound timing and precision before the RFP hits. We're actually used by a lot of teams who already have GovSpend, but need a move from reactive intel to proactive outreach. So think of it this way. Guffspin tells you where money was spent. Starbridge tells you where and when it's about to be. Oh, that's interesting. We use AI to surface best fit targets, decision makers messaging, so your reps aren't chasing bids. They're starting conversations before the bid exists. We're not trying to rip and replace. Early stage buyer. Okay, great. So we'll submit the training. We'll start our audition. We should probably use one of these talk tracks here. So we got a few. Jamie over at Starbridge. No, I'm catching out of the blue, But do you mind if I grab half a minute? I'll tell you why I called in. You can let me know if it's relevant or not. And then have you heard of Starbridge just by the half chance? Okay, gotcha. Well, before I get ahead myself, do you guys sell into SLED accounts like state, local education, K-12? Okay, no worries. Feel free to stop me if it's not making sense.  So quick thumbnail on us, Starbridge. Starbridge is a go-to-market intelligence platform built specifically for public sector sellers. Teams like ClearGov, GovWell, and CourseDog are using us to break into net new Sled accounts by spotting early buying signals before the traditional RFP window even opens. And so the big challenge we see right now and what we help solve is that most outbound motions in this space are still reactive, right? So you find out about the opportunity too late. You change public RFPs with little contacts and 80% of vendors are emailing the same generic. What our platform does is surface real time pre RFP buying signals from the sources. Most sellers don't have time to track. So think of contract expirations, board meeting minutes, strategic plans, budget lineups. That's a lot. That's this should be like rule of three. Contract expirations, board meeting minutes, and even grant approvals, just to name a few. So to cut to it, we help your team connect the dots on who to reach out to, why now, and what to say. So you're entering the conversation when timing, funding, and relevance are actually aligned. But super simple. You may not have a direct need or maybe you have used some type of intelligence before. But I just want to see if you'd be completely opposed to covering out 14, 15 minutes for a coffee break small chat just to walk through live buying signals we pulled in your market and how teams are building smarter outbound efforts around them. Would you be game to loop up, say, tomorrow or next week? Okay, that works. And then last thing before I catch you loose here, just so we can keep the chat room sweet. Okay. Question two, are you doing any type of intelligence now? Are you running any tools specifically for public sector? Civic sync, gov spend, authority. And then are you the one who taste tests? Okay, nice. That's not too bad. So thumbnail on us. Starbridge, we are a true AI driven outbound platform built specifically for folks selling into the public sector. And so we help by spotting early buying signals before the traditional RFP window even opens. What we're seeing across teams right now and really what we've helped remediate or remedy is most folks are still stuck being reactive, right? You hear about the project after the fact, you're chasing RFPs you have zero influence on. And then by then, it's a race to the bottom inbox fight. We now know that 80% of RFPs are pre-written for a selected vendor. So to cut to it, you know, if your team is still piecing together sled intel from five different tools websites or code lists we can give you one place that surfaces the right opportunities months earlier So what our platform does is surface real pre buying signals from the sources most sellers don even have time to track. So think of contract expirations, board meeting minutes, strategic plans, and even grant approvals, you name it. But to cut to it, we help your team create an actionable roadmap in who to reach out to, why now, and what to say. So you're answering the conversation when timing, funding, and relevance are actually aligned. But super simple, John, you might be already doing parts of this manually or working with enrichment tools like, you know, Zoom info or maybe GovSpend. Totally fine. But just want to see if you'd be completely opposed to carving out 14, 15 minutes for a Coffee Break style chat just to run an analysis specific to your market and see if there's something worth keeping in the back pocket. Just to run an analysis specific to your market and see if there's something. Okay. Would you begin to loop up, say, okay. There's some sequencing things we can do, like putting, there was one good riff, like 80% of RFPs are pre-run for a selected vendor. So it would probably sit right here. Quick thumbnail on us, and we help by spotting early bind signals before the traditional RFP window even opens. And so what we're seeing across teams right now, or what we're seeing in the market right now, how long was Justin at CourseDog? I don't even know what CourseDog is. Hold on, where's, I have LinkedIn. So Justin is the CEO and he was at course dog. What do they do? Academic operating system for higher education. Okay. So they sold into sled. Okay. That makes sense. So he built star bridge because they were trying to find a way, a better way to sell course dog into sled. Yeah, that makes sense. So that means being selling to sled, our executive team has sold into sled for the past more than half a decade here. Actually, this is since 2018. So that's what, seven years. So over the past seven years or so, our executive team has sold into the SLED accounts. We basically built a tool to sell into it. And what we've seen, basically you want to build up the status here, right? After selling into SLED for the past seven years, almost decade, turns out 80% of RIPs are pre-written for selected vendors. So the question is, number one, is there a way to find those accounts or find those intent signals, find those RFPs before they hit the open market. And so to cut to it, our breakthrough lies in our AI powered capability to send out these FOIA requests on your behalf in bulk You know we sent 10 FOIA requests a month to hunt down or to find those back channel RFP you know write before everyone else does Something like that. Okay. I think I got a good sense, but let's do the recording because it might take a little bit of time since it's a speed run here. It'll take a little bit of time for the approval to go through. So let's do that. And then that way we can wait and we can do some work in the interim. Hi, my name is Micah Vu. I am currently the number one rep on the Glen Cocoa platform and looking forward to getting Starbridge some qualified meetings. Thanks. Hi, my name is Mike. All right. Roleplay delivered the Starbridge AI script. Hey, John, this is Micah over at Starbridge. I know I'm catching out of the blue here, but do you mind if I grab half a minute? I'll tell you why I called and you can let me know if it's relevant or not. Okay. Appreciate that. Have you heard of Starbridge just by the off chance? Okay. No worries. Feel free to stop me if it's not making sense. But quick thumbnail on us, Starbridge, we are a true AI-driven outbound platform built specifically for folks selling into the public sector. And we help by spotting early buying signals before the traditional RFP window even opens. Kind of what we're seeing across teams right now that sell into SLED, and really what we've helped remedy is a lot of folks are still stuck being reactive. You know, you hear about the project after the fact, you're chasing RFPs you have zero influence on, you know, by then it's a race to the bottom inbox fight. And we kind of see that now 80% of RFPs are pre-run for a selected vendor. What our platform does is surface real time pre-RFP buying signals from the sources most sellers don't even have the time to track. So think of contract expirations, competitor contracts, board meeting minutes, and even grant approvals, you know, you name it. But to cut to it, John, you know, we help your team in creating an actionable roadmap who to reach out to why now and what to say so you're entering the conversation when timing funding and relevance are actually all aligned but super simple you might be already doing parts of this manually or even working with enrichment tools like zoom info or maybe gov spend but that's totally fine just want to see if you'd be completely opposed to carbon out 14 15 minutes for a coffee break style chat just to run an analysis specific to your market and see if it's something worth keeping in the back pocket for for down the road you game to loop up say tomorrow afternoon. Okay, sweet. Well, we have a 2 p.m. tomorrow, if that works for you. Great. Well, I'll send over an email calendar invite. What's the best email to send this to? Sweet. Well, I send this over And then last thing before I catch you loose here just so we can keep the chat short and sweet and it doesn turn into a Lord of the Rings marathon Okay gotcha And then anyone else you want to loop in for the chat no just you okay great i think that everything i have for you john outside of that i let you get back to it and uh yeah we'll talk on okay three minutes that's it uh hey john all right we have just submitted our audition and we are pending approval so we'll come back to that in a minute here and then while we're waiting for that, I think I want to do some screenplay writing. So let's make a copy. And I don't want to change much. I do like this one, Starbridge. So quick thumbnail on that, specifically public sector. We help by spotting early buying signals before it traditionally even opens. And so our executive team has been selling into SLED accounts for almost a decade now. And what we've found is that more than 80% of RFPs are pre-written. I should have made a copy of this one too. Are written for a, what we found is that more than 80% of RFPs are pre-written for a selected vendor. The big question is, is it possible to get in front of every target? Is it possible to get in front of every target, target agency slash school before you get lost in the stack of generic proposals? To cut to it, start our breakthrough through lies in our ability to aggregate our AI driven ability. AI driven AI driven ability to surface every single data point on. So on contract additions. I want to say like, for example, we identify MongoDB was trying to target the city of Santa Clara. And we found XYZ through board meeting YouTube video, one hour and 57 minutes, something like that. Very specific, but there's something there. There's something there for sure. Okay, so we should probably listen to some calls too while we're waiting. I got a pretty good grasp. We can listen to some of the calls as well. I already like the screenplay that they have here. I think the sequencing could be ever so slightly better if they led a little more with the problem space or the challenge.  change in the world. And I think 80% of RFPs are pre-written for a selected vendor. I think that's really good at the front end. Right after the status alignment, I should probably explain this. The winning formula for cold call screenplay is sort of modified permission-based opener. I have a whole video on that. Pattern interrupt into the big idea where you're going to do either, you can do an optional status alignment, the change in the world, right? So again, the problem space leading with the problem space, your unique value proposition, and then downsell. Some people call this a pullback and close. Then you schedule. Part of the scheduling is a tie down to confirm the meeting. Make sure they show qualification questions before ending the call. So this is going to be a combination of Sandler sales, Warren CLAF. So that's pitch anything, flip the script. Chris Beal. It's funny. I actually have pitch anything here. Chris Beal and Corey Frank. That's like the market dominance, market dominance theory. Chris Voss, never split the difference. Little straight line selling from Jordan Belford. little Hermosi in there kind of offer value stacking as well. Yeah, just a drawn from all sources to be super effective in outbound B2B cold calling. All right, so let's listen to a couple of the successful pitches and then we'll work on a message while we wait approval here. Hello. Hey, Amanda. Yes. Oh, hey, Amanda. This is Jimmy over at Starbridge. I know I'm catching you out of the blue here, but do you mind if I grab a quick half minute and I'll let you know why I called and pronounce you guys? Sure. That sounds good. I appreciate that. And before I get ahead of myself here, Amanda, do you guys sell into slid accounts like local government, municipal or education k12 anything like that uh i'll show you a little bit sorry education k12 so i think what i want to say is where is it i want to say if i'm going to do the do you sell into sled so you get two different pattern interrupt choices here so i'm going to say pattern interrupt one and then interrupt two so it's like a choose your own adventure okay I can take pattern interrupt one and okay, what's up with the spacing? All right, whatever. Okay, so actually, it's going to annoy me. Spacing single. Hello. Hello, I'd like to speak to Dan. Oh, hello, Dan. My name is Fred Olson. I'm with a company called Starbridge AI. Now, first of all, did I catch you at a good time? I've got like two minutes. I'm just going to do something, but I don't even need 30 seconds. You tell me whether this is relevant to you, something that might interest you guys. So the company is called Starbridge AI, and what we are is we're an AI platform that basically searches every corner of the public sector for the internet. Our custom AI agents service your best accounts weeks before an RFP drops. So think of it like this. We looking at board meeting minutes upcoming competitive contract expiration strategic plans RFPs before they go live This basically allows you to do things like enrich your crm generate ultra personalized emails also autograph rfps and hours not days uh teams aren generally booking five to seven times more leads now um if this sounds like something that you guys might want to take a look at what i can do is set up a little 15-minute meeting where we can i show you the unique signals in your market does that sound like something you guys would have time for next week i'm actually out next week but um you know if you don't mind i mean i guess my question would be uh what most of my customers are state level um so by the state government yeah just state just state governments okay Yes, I'm curious how you're getting kind of ahead of some of these RFE. That is a great question. That's something that's above my pay grade. I'm just the appointment setter. What I can do is, will you be back the following week? Can you book like 15 minutes, maybe something like that second week of August? You know, I'm going to be confused. I'm in next week. If we want to grab next Friday, do it. Okay, I got a couple of quick questions just to kind of make sure everybody's on the same page. First of all, 617, are you in Massachusetts? You're in Boston? Okay, so Eastern time. Okay, I'm down here in New Orleans. Oh, lucky you. I take care of my mother. I was really in California. But let's see. What do we got? All right. Let's see. So good. How many, how many people generally report to you? So I don't have any direct reports, but I have a whole team of, you know, probably 10 folks in the pursuit teams. Okay. Great. All right. So let me go ahead and let's get a time for it. All right. Next, see, and what phone number? We'll go ahead and I will do it. I will send you a calendar invite, state governments. That's all 50 states, including Alaska and Hawaii. I'm asking. I'll get through there. Maine has one of the most beautiful places in Far Harbor. I was like, all right. You got to say, right? Far Harbor. Yeah. That's it. Great. Yeah. I look forward to it. Appreciate it. And you take care. We'll see you then. I'll send you. Okay, let's see. Are we ready yet? Let's take a peek over my campaigns. Approved. Okay, great. Ready to call. That was like 20 or so minutes. Usually that's how long it takes. So we'll go ahead and load up a list here. What's really nice is everything's just done on the Glencoe platform. So they give you the leads. They give you obviously the campaign to call on and let's go. I think we're going to run with, so let's get this out of the way and let's pull this bad boy up. I we're gonna run with maybe this one first and then we'll keep crafting this one as we go along and then i also want to just have the website up so while i'm dialing i can do some more research okay all right let's run it 93 leads loaded up hey megan who's calling oh yeah i was looking for uh megan uh yeah she doesn't work here anymore that's i was just asking who's calling oh shoot okay Okay, sorry about that. Yeah, name's Micah. Are you no longer at CCI? No, I am. Oh, you are, okay, gotcha. Yeah, again, name's Micah. I'm over here at Starbridge. Just gonna say, I know I'm catching out of the blue, but I guess you mind if I grab half a minute, I'll tell you why I called and you can let me know if it relevant or not Sure Okay appreciate that So and then before I get ahead of myself do you guys sell into slight accounts like state local education I sorry I don understand the question Do you sell to like state local or like government accounts, education K12? Is that who you guys? Yeah, I just can't really answer questions about our business without really knowing like who you are and why you're calling. I'm just I'm sorry, I get a lot of these calls. I just, I just need to understand more. For sure. For sure. All right. Let's think. I'll give you the quick 10-second thumbnail and just cut me off if it's not in your wheelhouse. But Starbridge, we are a true AI-driven outbound platform built specifically for folks selling into the public sector. And so we help by spotting early buying signals before the traditional RFP window even opens. And so, you know, what our platform does is surface real-time pre-RFP buying signals from sources, you know, most sellers don't even have time to track. So think of contract expirations, competitor contracts, board meeting minutes, and even like grant approvals, you name it. But to cut to it, you know, we help your team in creating actionable, like an actionable roadmap in who to reach out to, why now and what to say. so you're entering the conversation when timing, funding, and relevance are actually aligned. But super simple, Megan. Don't want to overstay my welcome here. And I know you might be using a tool like ZoomInfo or maybe GovSpin already, so totally fine. But I just want to see if you'd be completely opposed to carving out 14, 15 minutes for a coffee break style chat just to share kind of like a virtual tour of the platform and share our lesser known approach to breaking into more SLED accounts. Do you happen to have your calendar available? I'm not interested at the time, but I can see what you do. I don't see a direct use case for what we do, but if you send me an email summary, I can get back to you if anything changes. Yeah, for sure. More than happy to send a note here. What is the best email to send a note to? Whatever email you have in the system, I'll get. If you had Megan's old email, I'll get it. Yeah, I had megan.com. Yeah, I'll get that. Okay, sweet. Well, I'll send a note here and then, yeah, we'll go from there. See if it's relevant. All right. Thank you. Okay. Thanks. Bye. That was really weird. Okay. I'm just going to say not relevant persona. That's probably it. Not relevant. And it might not even be Megan That an odd one Okay I was kind of bouncing around here I need to just clean this up I not a huge fan of asking find out questions early on I get that it saves time but all right. Oh, Hey Antonio. Oh yeah. Hey Antonio. It's a Micah, um, over at Starbridge. Um, you know, I was just going to say, I'm, I know I'm catching out the blue here, but I guess, do you mind if I grab a half a minute, I'll tell you why I called and you can Let me know if it's relevant or not. Sure. Okay. Appreciate that. So, and then before I get ahead of myself, um, do you guys sell into sled accounts like state, local education? So I can repeat that. Do you guys sell into like state, local, or like government, uh, accounts? Rarely. Not really. Not really. Okay. Hmm. This might not be super relevant, but maybe I'll give you the 10 second thumbnail version and just cut me off if it's just outside of your swim lane. But quick thumbnail on us, Starbridge, we are a true AI-driven outbound platform built specifically for folks selling into the public sector. And so our team has been selling into SLED accounts for almost a decade now. And what we found is that more than 80% of RFPs are pre-written for selected vendors. So the big question is, you know, is it possible to get in front of every one of your target agencies or schools, if you're going after K-12, before you get lost in the stack of generic proposals. And so to cut to it, Antonio, our breakthrough lies in our AI-driven ability to surface every single intent signal from crawling, you know, board meeting minutes, contract expirations, and strategic plans, and doing it in a way where you can see line by line what your competitor is selling, you know, who they're selling to, and, you know, when those renewals are up. So pretty bananas in this space. But super simple. My timing's probably off. And like I said, you know, we're not a fit for every team. But that's exactly why we've been hosting these 15-minute Zoom screen shares, just to showcase the dashboards in AI in action. And then from there, if there's even a remote interest, the idea is to get some of these high intent accounts into your hands and see, you know, if you guys can close one or two of them in a 30-day proof of concept. So yeah, would you be game to loop up, say, tomorrow afternoon? No, pass for now. Thank you, though. Can we ask the name of the company again? Can I keep it in mind? Yeah, Starbridge AI. So we're at Starbridge AI or Starbridge.ai. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. No worries.  Well, yeah, I'll mark you down here so we don't keep bugging you. And then, so yeah, just to be clear, you guys don't really like, like sled and like government agencies or schools. That's not necessarily your bread and butter. No, no. But I just want to keep in mind if at some point that was going to be the case. But by the way, nothing at this moment indicates that. I just want to be aware. For sure. For sure. Okay. Well, that's why I appreciate the call. Yeah, of course. Yeah, no worries. Thank you for everything. Yep. Appreciate it. Take care now. All right. Bye. All right. So not relevant persona. Sled is not a priority for them. I'm going to say Sled accounts. Accounts are not a priority for them. So that's twice now that they're like, what? 10, 382, 6, 3, 2, 4. Leave a message at the town. Thanks. You guys sell into state, local or. Hey, Taryn. Pardon me? Yeah, I was looking for a Taryn. no i think he got the wrong number oh shoot sorry about that did i even call up no okay not on this number okay okay no worries sorry about that that's all right all right bye do you guys even hey chris yes this is chris and i help oh yeah hey chris it's uh micah um over at starbridge you know i know i'm catching out of the blue here but i guess do you mind if i grab half a minute i'll tell you why i called and you can let me know if it's relevant or not what is this about yeah let's think um does starbridge uh does that name ring a bell just by the off chance no okay gotcha no worries um oh yeah feel free to stop me at any point then if it's not making sense but quick thumbnail on us uh starbridge we are a true ai driven outbound platform built specifically for folks selling into the public sector and so really our team has been selling into SLED accounts for almost a decade now. And what we found is that more than 80% of RFPs are pre-written for a selected vendor. So the big question is, you know, is it possible to get in front of every one of your target agencies or schools if you're going after K-12 before you get lost in the stack of generic proposals? And so to cut to it, you know, our breakthrough lies in our, again, AI-driven ability to surface every single intent signal from crawling board meeting minutes strategic plans and even grant approvals and doing it in a way where bro come here it a little long I don love again I don love that it like our team give him a call back though hello oh yeah Chris can you hear me yeah hello yeah sorry I lost you there um maybe I could cut to the chase where did I lose you at uh you were talking about AI something yeah yeah so So yeah, kind of our big idea is we're able to surface every single like intent signal from crawling like board minute meetings, strategic plans and grant approvals. And then we do it in a way where you can see line by line, you know, what your competitors are selling, who they're selling to and when their contracts aspire. If you don't mind, I don't, I'm not sure how this impacts me. I'm not in like, I don't own a business or anything. Oh, shoot. Okay, are you not at Pulse CFO nor Spring Health? No, you might have the wrong person. Gotcha. Okay, sorry about that then. Yeah, I'll mark it down. No problem. Okay, yeah, no worries. Take care. Have a good one. Bye. You as well. Bye. All right, so someone picked up, but there's not person history. Okay, that's fine. Hey, Sonia. Yeah. Yeah, hey, Sonia. It's Micah over at Starbridge. I know I'm catching out of the blue here, but I guess do you mind if I grab a half a minute? I'll tell you why I called and you can let me know if it's relevant or not. Yeah, half a minute. Okay, clock's ticking. Appreciate that. Before I get ahead of myself, do you guys sell into government or education accounts, like slight accounts? We sell school districts. Okay, perfect. Well, this should be in your wheelhouse, but cut me off at any point if it's not. But yeah, quick 10 second thumbnail. Starbridge, we are a go-to-market intelligence platform built specifically for folks selling into the public sector. And so what we're seeing from a high level is that more than 80% of RFPs are pre-written for a selected vendor. The big question is, you know, is it possible to get in front of every one of your target schools before you get lost in the stack of generic proposals? To cut to it, our breakthrough lies in our AI-driven ability to surface every single intent signal from, you know, crawling board meeting minutes, strategic plans, and even grant approvals. And we do it in a way where you can see line by line what your competitors are selling, who they're selling to, and when their contract expire, which is pretty bananas in this space. But super simple, Sonia. You know, I'm probably past my half minute here. And I know you might be already using tools like ZoomInfo or even GovSpend But that exactly why we been hosting these 15 Zoom screen shares just to showcase the dashboards and AI in action And then from there, if there's even a remote interest, the idea is to get some of these high intent accounts into your hands and then maybe have you close one or two of them in a proof of concept. Yeah, I've tried both of those and none of them worked for me. Neither of those worked for you. We hear that quite often. So that's kind of why we're doing things a little different. Would you have any open slots maybe tomorrow afternoon? I don't know if intent really works for us. Oh, okay. How come? Yeah, because it's government. It's not. Turns out you go after every single message or every single signal that's happening with school districts, and I can't use that. I need to know who's looking for routing software, period. That's it. So it's more of a who's searching for the specific long tail keywords that we're looking for. And I'm doing that already with another company called Pearl Diver. So that's what I'm using. No way. I used I used to work with pearl divers because they do the pixel. They do the pixels on the on the websites. Well, they used to. And then they used to do mail before that when they were like pro mail. So that's a small world. But okay. Yeah. I don't want to waste your time, Sonia. Don't have the funds for anything else. Okay. Yeah, definitely. I want to rule. Yeah, yeah, definitely. I'll mark you down here so we don't keep on you. I will say what you mentioned with like targeting specific people with like keywords and phrases is actually something we help out with. We don't want to inundate you with white noise. Again, we're not a fit for every team, but up to you. Would it be a ridiculous idea to kind of share a lesser known approach? And then from there, you can keep us in the back pocket for down the meeting starting in two minutes, which is why I said you had half a minute. So yeah, if you want to check in next year, maybe, you know, things will change then. Okay. Thank you. Bye bye. All right. Take care. Bye. Oh, come on. Come on. Come here, Sonia. All right. We're going to go decision maker. I'm going to say not qualified. Pitch rejected, not qualified, maybe timing. We'll give her 30 days. She won't make it in for this speed run, but dude, I was feeling that I was feeling it. Okay. So her whole thing is long tail keywords, key words. Dang. Okay. So hold on. I just didn't say the magic words. I just didn't say the magic words. Okay. So let's go here. Okay. Not qualified timing, full pitch. Sonia said they've tried tools like of. And it's funny because I actually hurled divers was one of my clients at one point. And then Guffspend was one of my clients at one point. So Guffspend and Zoom info and they don work for her She uses her old divers Yeah That one wasn like I don think that she was uninterested I think she just had a meeting So she like come on, come on, come on. We got to go to the meeting. Yeah. We'll definitely catch her another time. They don't work for her. She's pearl divers and it's working well. Biggest feature is to find the proper contacts and contracts based on long tail. Don't know what what that means. Keywords and phrases. All right, we'll come back around. Oh, hey, Ellie. Yes. Yeah. Hey, Ellie. It's Micah over at Starbridge. I know I'm catching out of the blue here, but I guess do you mind if I grab half a minute? I'll tell you why I called and you can let me know if it's relevant or not. Yeah, for sure. Okay, appreciate that. Before I get ahead of myself, do you guys sell into government or education accounts, like sled accounts? Yes. You do. Okay, great. So this should be in your wheelhouse, but yeah, feel free to cut me off at any point if it's not. Quick thumbnail on us, Starbridge, we are a go-to-market intelligence platform built specifically for folks selling into the public sector. What we're seeing from a high level is that, you know, more than 80% of RFPs are pre-written for a selected vendor. The big question is, you know, is it possible to get in front of every one of your target accounts, you know, whether that's agencies or schools, if you're going after K-12, before you get lost in the stack of generic proposals. To cut to it, our breakthrough lies in our AI-driven ability to surface every single intent signal from board meeting minutes, strategic plans, and even grant approvals, and doing it in a way where you can see line by line what your competitors are selling, who they're selling to, and when their contracts expire. Okay. Pretty bananas in this space. But super simple, Ellie. You know, my timing's probably off here. And I know you might already be using tools like, you know, ZoomInfo or GovSpend, maybe Pearl Divers. Maybe it's working. Maybe it's not. But that's exactly why we've been hosting these like 15 minute Zoom screen shares just to showcase the dashboards and AI in action. And then from there, maybe you keep us in the back pocket. Yeah, we've actually been looking for, you know, lead generation and that kind of thing. And based in the Denver area, do you guys cover nationwide or are you like region specific? We are nationwide and we only do U.S. So as long as you guys are trying to target international contacts and accounts, we support all the U.S. regions. Okay. Yeah. You have time. Maybe it's like tomorrow, Friday or next Monday. That would work best for my schedule for like a quick intro. Yeah, for sure. Are you so Denver?  are you guys on time yeah mountain time on time so for tomorrow let's see what we have honestly actually yeah we've got an 8 a.m 10 and 11 30 and a 2 if any of those slots work for you yeah is that mountain time mountain time that's right okay sorry i'm in minneapolis right now so so the 9 a.m central i'll switch my calendar to central yeah 9 a.m central okay that should work Okay, cool. Well, what I can do, Ellie, I can make it easy on you. I'll send you an email calendar invite. That way our schedule's aligned. And then if any fires or meetings pop up while you're traveling there, then you can just edit the calendar link. Okay. And what email do you have listed? Yeah. I don't know if this is still up to date, but I had... Is that out? It's actually just eFrederick. Okay. Tech.com. Yes. Okay. Well, I'll go ahead and get this sent over. So yeah, whenever you see a pop up, feel free to hit accept that way. I know I didn't fat finger anything. But yeah, we'll keep this first chat high level. I do know some folks like to hone in on one or two specific areas, depending on, you know, what's kind of holding them hostage. You know, maybe it's wasted time chasing low intent accounts, maybe missing RFP windows because, you know, no one saw it in time or maybe generic messaging is not quite landing. But I guess for your team, what's been the biggest roadblock lately? We just, so we had an inside salesperson and it wasn't generating enough meetings per week and he left recently. So we're kind of looking for a platform that will kind of be all encompassing. For sure. Okay. That's definitely something we can support. And then anyone else you want to loop in for the chat that typically kind of kicks the tires on these things with you? Right now, just me. Eventually I want to loop in my boss, but he kind of wants me to vet out some potential platforms. For sure. Okay. And then let's think. So you want to target specifically the Denver region or like what region did you mention an accounts? Denver. Yeah, Denver is going to be our main priority. We're headquartered in Denver. And then we have locations across the country. For example, we have one in Arizona, one in Minneapolis, one in Chicago, and then Connecticut. So we're kind of across the board. But yeah, Denver right now is our main focus. Okay. Denver is the main focus. And then you guys target state, education. Kind of everything. Yeah we done we do like historically a lot of government facilities We do a lot of public libraries and right now I kind of also focusing on like the private sector but yeah schools and universities are are a good vertical for us to target Gotcha. Okay, sweet. Yeah. That's definitely in our, in our wheelhouse. Okay. I think that's about everything I have for you. Anything else you want me to kind of take notes here? We can just make best use of the time kind of showcase. I think that's good for now and then we can, we'll chat tomorrow morning. Okay. All right. Sounds good, Ellie. Well, yeah, appreciate the time here and looking forward to chatting. Oh, did you see the calendar invite come through? Let me check. Actually, let me make one adjustment. It might have come through already, but I'm going to edit one thing. I had Sentinel Maintenance, but then also... What's the actual name of the company? Okay. I did not receive it, but it might have gone to my quarantine, which should come through in a couple hours. Okay, yeah. You'll see it. So it's my director, Ben. And then, yeah, it's Calendly. I know sometimes Calendly gets stuck in limbo, depending on what things you have. Okay. Oh, sorry. Last question here. How many folks, so you just had one sales rep, one inside sales person, but now is. Yeah, we just had one for the whole, for, you know, nationally. Gotcha. So I got it. I got it. Okay, sweet. How many folks in total, like typically pursue accounts with you in the slide space? Like how many clients? No, like how many internal reps do you guys, or maybe contract reps do you guys have? So we have a proposal team. There's about six people on that team. And then Our team is the outside sales team and we have, I think there's six of us on that team, but I'm so sorry. I have to cut this short. I was actually in an Uber, but yeah, no worries. Okay. We will chat tomorrow morning then. Okay. Yeah. Sounds good. We'll talk then. All right. Thanks. Bye. Thanks. Take care. Bye. Boom. Here we go. Here we go. All right. Meeting scheduled. We are in business. Let's see how many it took to get there. Took five conversations with the right ICP. So one in five not terrible 20 conversion rate i think there was one earlier i definitely could have got i'll take that one okay so meeting scheduled 9 17 and we got it for tomorrow morning so six outside sales reps six folks on the proposal team had an inside sales person couldn't deliver looking for global accounts public libraries schools universities that's got to be primo for sure at eight i'm gonna say 9 a.m central time ellie said they are actively looking actively looking for a lead gen tool as they had one full inside a sales rep but they let that person go because they weren't booking enough meetings. They are looking lead gen tool they had one full-time target education accounts across the U.S., including Denver, Arizona, Chicago, Connecticut, and Colorado, California, Arizona, Illinois, including Connecticut. They have six employees on the proposal team, another six on the outside sales team. Ellie will be handling this first call on her own as her boss has mandated her to review potential vendors. They are looking for and all encompassing tool. Side note, she is traveling in Minneapolis right now. And I caught her and I caught her jumping out the Uber. So I'm just going to post this in Remote Sales Nation, which is like our sales training community that supports Glen Cocoa callers. And what are we at today. My the first deal of the day. All right. Early bird gets the worm. Starbridge meeting scheduled Legion tool history call recording download drop this in here recent download lines list. Boom. Nice. That seemed like a pretty good one. And we got that one pretty early into our speed run. I think that's probably like two and a half, three hours into the speed run Not too shabby. 25% conversion rate off of conversations with the right ICP. It's booked for tomorrow morning. Best case scenario, we can just close out the speed run. Okay, keep it going. I'm feeling pretty good about this one. Go to market intelligence. Your conversation is being recorded. 911 restoration. How can I help? Hey, how's it going? I was looking for a Christian. I do apologize. A Christian is not with us anymore. However, I can help you. Whatever like Christian do for you. Oh, gotcha. Okay. Yeah. Yeah Do you know who took his place as the biz dev manager Yep Let me connect with you right now with him Can I have your name and like your information before I transfer it Yeah And what was their name as well His name is Kyle Kyle. Okay, cool. Yeah. Just like Kyle, no, it's a Micah. Micah. Micah from? Starbridge. Starbridge. Okay. Give me a minute. I'm going to connect with you now. Okay. Thank you. Have a good day. You as well. Your conversation is being recorded. This is Kyle. How can I help you? Hey, Kyle. It's Micah over at Starbridge. We were previously connected with Rishan, but I'm guessing He's sounds like he's not there anymore. And you took his place. I'm not in sales, but I was a supervisor. OK, let me know if this is still relevant or not. Does Starbridge ring a bell just by the off chance? I don't know, but he did not turn in his book of business when he left. I don't know of all of his connections. I've still been trying to source that from his emails. OK, well, yeah, then I can give you the quick rundown and you can let me know if it's still relevant today. So, yeah, quick thumbnail on us. Starbridge, we are a go to market intelligence platform built. specifically for folks selling into the public sector. Kind of what we're seeing from a high level is that more than 80% of RFPs are pre-written for a selected vendor. So the big question is, from a sales perspective, is it possible to get in front of every one of your target agencies or schools, if you're going after K-12, before you get lost in the stack of generic proposals? And so to cut to it, our breakthrough lies in our ability to surface every single intent signal from board meetings, strategic plans, and even grant approvals, doing it in a way where you can see line by line, you know, what your competitors are selling, who they're selling to, and when their contracts expire. So pretty bananas in this space, but super simple, Kyle, we're not a fit for every team. And obviously I'm sure you guys are using tools like ZoomInfo, GovSpend, maybe Pearl Divers, maybe they're working, maybe they're not, but that's exactly why we've been hosting these 15 minute Zoom screen shares, just to showcase the dashboards and AI in action, And then from there, you know, maybe you keep us in the back pocket for down the road. So, yeah, would you be game to loop up for 15 minutes, say tomorrow afternoon? Yeah, but not tomorrow afternoon. I would be able to do tomorrow's Wednesday, not Thursday. So I could do tomorrow afternoon. I just can't do Thursday. I'm sorry. I had my days off. Oh, no worries. And are you guys Eastern time or? Yes, we're Eastern time. Eastern time. So for tomorrow, we have a noon, a 1.30 and a 4. Noon sounds good. Okay, sweet. Well, I'll make it easy on you, Kyle. I'll send you an email calendar invite. That way our schedules align. Let's see. So yeah, I had all of Chris  questions info on this. I can give you my info if that's easier. Yeah, for sure. I go for it. My email is KBARLE.com. Okay, sweet. Yep. And then what is a better phone number? Sure. It's 8020. 20. Okay, sweet. Well, I just went ahead and sent it. So yeah, whenever you see a pop up, feel free to hit accept. That way I know I didn't fat finger anything. Oh, and then one thing we do ask, I know meetings and fires can pop up out of the blue. Totally fine. But how would you like to let us know if you can't make it. Probably via email. Okay. Yeah, that works through the calendar invite. Okay. Okay, sweet. Well, I think that's about it. Oh, and then yeah, for this first chat, we'll keep it high level, like 10,000 foot overview. I do know some folks like to hone in on one or two specific areas, depending on kind of what's holding them hostage when they're, you know, going after these slight accounts. Could be anything from, you know, wasted time chasing low intent kind of agencies, maybe missing the RFP windows because no one saw it in time. But I guess for your team, what's sort of the biggest roadblock been lately? Just at the moment, I don't particularly have a business development representative. So I need something that will assist me in my efforts until I can replace the position. It's a lot for me working for multiple different branches of this company and keeping up with like all of these things because this isn't what I tactically do. I'm just kind of stepping in to fill the void, if you will. Another thing that I'm having roadblocks with is getting through the gatekeeper at certain companies. A lot of places are very much like right when you come in, they immediately like shut you down, shoo you away. So we've been trying to approach from like an inside sales perspective and kind of trying to connect with owners on LinkedIn, things of that nature. But we're trying to find like more creative ways to approach these vendors. Knowing when the contract expires is huge because that gives us like the perfect time window, like that sweet spot to kind of deal it. I don't like using that word, but you know, essentially like acquire a new contract because you know they're coming to the end of another one. So like those things are actually pretty huge. For sure. So I do like that. That's definitely in our swim lane. And I think you'll be pleasantly surprised because we kind of have a holistic approach to reaching out to slight accounts and you can kind of draft up RFPs and you have all that kind of line by line Intel straight from the platform. Yeah, that's definitely something we can dive into. And then anyone else you want to loop in that typically kind of kicks the tires on on these things with you? At this time, it's pretty much just me. I'm not going to So that's okay. No worries. Well, yeah, let me go ahead and let you get back to it here. Is there anything else you have for me? You want me to kind of relate to the team here for our chat No I think that just kind of giving me a full presentation so I fully understand tomorrow would be great Okay And I haven seen your email come through by the way Can we just confirm my email one more time Yeah let me see Sometimes it takes a second because it a calendly link. It should be from Zach, my director, Kuzner. Oh, I just got it. It just took a second. I just got it. Okay, perfect. Okay. All right, Kyle. Well, yeah, appreciate the time here. And yeah, we look forward to chatting tomorrow at noon. And until then, stay safe. Okay. Yeah, You as well. Bye bye. Okay. Thanks, Carl. Take care. Bye bye. Boom! Another one. Another one. And it's in the morning again. Let's freaking go. I think the highlight for that deal is it was a gatekeeper that said the contact was not available because that contact was no longer there. Me asking for the new replacement, me talking to the new replacement and finding out that there's a need and then booking them for a meeting. So that's a really good example of like, you just always got to find your deal that's my mindset like where's my next deal and someone's out there i just got to find them okay meeting scheduled meeting scheduled for 9 17 2025 at 12 p.m eastern time originally i was trying to connect with however the gatekeeper said he was no longer at the company and that Kyle took over he needs to find another business development app but in the interim is looking for a tool to help him target these sled accounts his biggest challenge is getting past gate-ers. So looking any way to get too creatively to get around the front door is a focus. If any fires pop up, he will respond via the calendar invite. All right, good amount of context there and we'll go ahead and post it in here again star bridge interim oops spelled interim wrong okay nice let keep it going let look at the stats little stat check one hour 22 minutes on the dialer 11 pickups six conversations with the right icp and two booked meetings so that means we booking one in three 33 conversion rate not too shabby all right i just gonna grab his phone number real quick just make sure all the contact info is updated all right view account kyle edit lead 20. nice nice nice general manager edit lead general manager all right we'll keep that gentleman nice and clean okay all right looking good let's keep it going i need to do that let's refresh it general manager boom okay nice let's keep it going boy i can't come to the phone right now but please leave a message and i'll get back to you as soon as i can thanks so much bye email and continue dialing dude this the emailing tool on glencoco it's great it's great when it works and it's been working so it's great good afternoon environmental how may i help you today hi good afternoon uh looking for john sure i can double check if he is available and may know the reason for the call yeah he should know it's uh micah i'm sorry i said he should know it's uh micah micah is your name that's correct yep okay thank you and sorry the company name that you're coming from yeah star bridge thank you all right and just to confirm you are an existing client with us yeah again yes he should know what this is about okay all right i will just put you on a brief hold to try his line for you okay okay thank you so much hi there thank you so much for holding okay i don't have him available but i can send him a message for you if you would like. That's okay. I might just hit him on his personal line then. Okay. Don't worry about that. Yeah, no worries. All right. Appreciate it. Take care. All right. You're welcome. Bye. I'm not going to actually call his personal line. I'm just going to throw him back in the list and have the auto dialer do it. But we'll put it in there. Yeah, it's all about speed to conversation. So unless it's like a high intent, like a really strong referral or similar, I'll usually just throw them back in into the dialer. Please leave your message for 9782651412. Boy, I can't come to the phone right now, but please leave a message and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. Thanks so much. Bye. Oh hey Don Oh hello Three two one Oh, hey, Deb. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Hey, Deb. It's Micah over at Starbridge. You know, I know I'm catching out of the blue here, but I guess do you mind if I grab half a minute? I'll tell you why I called and you can let me know if it's relevant or not. Okay. Okay. Okay. Appreciate that. So, oh, and then before I get ahead of myself, do you guys sell into government or education accounts, like SLED accounts? Listen, I work for a completely different company. I don't have anything to do with any of that sort of thing, Mike. So I don't think we need to continue. Thanks. Oh, shoot. Okay. Okay. Watchman Therapy Awareness Regional Manager. Interesting. She is at a different company. Okay. I would say bad data. It's fine. What am I doing here? She works at a different company now. That's fine. It needs to get updated anyway, so Boston Scientific. But yeah, no. Oh, hey, Patrick. At the tone, please record your message. When you've finished recording, you may hang up or press 1 for more options. But so far, so good. I think we've had some pretty decent conversations. Now it leaves that noon. What is it? Eastern time? 1.30. It left. This is like a coveted spot right here. I could definitely snag the next prospect here or here. Maybe here. This one's a little early, but that's pretty good. See how many dials we've made. 300A dials so far. Yeah, not too bad. 20 pickups. Oh, hey, Alexis. Yes, this is Alexis. Yeah. Hey, Alexis. This is Micah over at Star Bridge. I know I'm catching on the blue here, but I guess do you mind if I grab a half a minute? I'll tell you why I called and you can let me know if it's relevant or not. Sure. Okay. Appreciate that. So before I get ahead of myself, do you guys sell into government or education accounts, like SLED accounts at all? I'm sorry, say it one more time, SLED account? Yeah, SLED. Like, do you guys bid on government contracts or sell to like K-12? Not so much K-12, but government contracts sometimes. Okay. Okay. Then in that case, this might should be relevant, but if it's not, just cut me off at any point. But quick thumbnail on us, Starbridge, we are a go-to-market intelligence platform built specifically for folks selling into the public sector. What we've been seeing from a high level is that more than 80% of RFPs are pre-written for a selected vendor. So the big question is, you know, is it possible to get in front of every  every one of your target agencies before you get lost in the stack of generic proposals. And so to cut to it, our breakthrough lies in our AI-driven ability to surface every single intent signal through, you know, think our board meeting minutes, strategic plans, and even grant approvals. And then we do it in a way where you can see line by line what your competitors are selling, who they're selling to, and when their contracts expire, which is pretty bananas in the space. But super simple, Alexis, you know, my timing's probably off here. And obviously, I'm sure you guys have a pretty robust tool stack in place already but that's exactly why we've been hosting these 15 minute sort of like zoom screen shares just to showcase the dashboards and ai in action and then from there you know maybe you can keep us in the back pocket or down the road so yeah would you be game to loop up say tomorrow afternoon actually let me look because i think that i think it might be worth you you know pitching something and kind of talking more about the concept but i will say this week and next week is just so busy for us i mean i'm looking that counter real quick to the sure and then by the way we typically block out 30 minutes but usually it takes like 15 minutes to give you the the quick high level and then sometimes folks have questions after that what time zone are you operating in central standard central standard so it's 241 over there 241 okay gotcha i think this friday would be okay yeah i guess this friday would be fine i feel a little difficult sorry i'm trying because we're also moving so it's kind of Yeah, all good. I'll give you the slots. So we have a noon and a 3.30 on Friday. And then we also have 12.30 tomorrow. We could squeeze you in, but that's about it for this week. So 12.30 tomorrow and then noon and 3.30 on Friday. Let's do 12 o'clock on Friday. 12 o'clock on Friday. Okay, cool. Well, I'll make it easier on you, Alexis. I'll send you an email, a calendar invite, the way our schedules align. And then if any fires, sounds like you guys have a lot of moving parts. If there's any fires that pop up, then you can just request a new time on the email if that works for you. Yeah. Sounds good. Thank you for your call. I appreciate it. Yeah. And what's the best email to send this to? Oh, yes. It's going to be dot com. Okay, sweet. Yeah. I'll get this sent over and then feel free to hit accept once you see it pop up. And then anyone else you want to loop in or do you want to fly solo for this first one? Right now, if you just send it to me, I'll talk about it with some other people. And if they're interested, I'll forward them the invite. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Sounds good, Alexis. Well, I think that's everything I have for you. And then we at starbridge It be on the calendar invite but starbridge So if you want to do your research on us in the interim feel free to check us out there as well Okay Sounds good Thank you so much Okay Alexis Well yeah I appreciate the time and look forward to chatting on Friday Yeah. Thank you. Have a good one. All right. You guys all take care. Bye-bye. Meeting schedule. It's set for Friday though. So I don't want to wait. All right. We will go ahead and post the deal. The yo three. Is this thing on? Who's going to carry the boats? It's okay. I will. I'll do it. If you insist, if I must, if I must. Alright, I'm gonna stick with this one. Carry the boat. Who's gonna carry the boats? Ya boi. Alright, where am I? Bing, bang, boom, bing, bang, boom. Easy peasy, lemon squeezy. Hey. Hey, how's it going? Looking for Brent. Alright, can I tell him he's calling? Yeah, let me know it's Micah Vu. Thank you. Micah Vu, okay. And where are you calling from? Yeah, I'm over here at Starbridge. Thanks. Alright, hang on one second. Yep. Privately owned for over 20 years, Premier Commercial Security is your partner in peace of mind. Alright, I'm speedrunning. It's a senior sales consultant. It's probably too low level. Oh, hey Rachel. Too slow. Let's try again. 3, 2, 1. Your call has been forwarded to voicemail. The person you're trying to reach is not available. At the tone, please record your message when you have finished. Alright, so I really do like this holding you hostage riff when collecting the qualification questions. Oh, hey, Sean. What's Sean? Oh, yeah. Hey, Sean. It's Micah over at Starbridge. You know, I know I'm catching out of the blue here, but I guess do you mind if I grab half a minute? I'll tell you why I called and you can let me know if it's relevant or not. What's going on? Yeah. So and then before I waste any more of your time, do you guys sell into government or education accounts? We sell education and government. Okay. Gotcha. So yeah, this should be in your wheelhouse, but yeah, just cut me off at any point if it's not. Um, quick thumbnail on us, Starbridge, we are a go-to-market intelligence platform built specifically for folks selling into the public sector. And, and so what we're seeing from a high level is that, you know, more than 80% of RFPs are pre-written for a selected vendor. So the big question is, you know, is it possible to get in front of every one of your target agencies or, or schools, you know, if you're going after K-12, um, before you get lost in the stack of generic proposals. And so to cut to it you know our breakthrough lies in our AI driven ability to surface every single intent signal through think board meeting minutes strategic plans and even grant approvals and then doing it in a way where you can see line by line what your competitors are selling who they selling to and when their contracts expire so it's pretty bananas in the space but super simple Sean you know my timing's probably off here and obviously I know you and the folks are probably using tools already like ZoomInfo, GovSpend, maybe Pearl Divers maybe some are working maybe some aren't but that's exactly why we're we've been hosting these 15 minute zoom screen shares if you will just to showcase the dashboards in AI in action and then from there you know maybe you keep us in the back pocket for for down the road so yeah would you be game to loop up for 15 minutes say tomorrow afternoon do you are these just webinars or they scheduled meetings scheduled meetings so we like to make sure it's like relevant to exactly what you guys are looking at but you said K through 12. Yeah, that's right. That's the space that you're thriving in. We're higher education. Higher education, yep. That's, yep. U.S. based only though. So if you guys are international, we don't support that. But any higher education or, you know, anything government funded in the U.S. is really our sweet spot. So how is this system used? Because we do use, we have Zoom Info, we have fam.gov that we get our bits from. There's not like a lack of resources that we have a problem with. that we're a very niche business. So it's like, we don't need to pay for something else that has not given us the business where the bids are coming through. We feel like we're in the right space to get the bids. We deal with a lot of mechanicals and general contractors. So they typically send it to us directly. We're not having typically hunt for it because they know who we are. We've been around for 34 years. So I don't know if it's just something that we we have the ability right now to even budget right now. Right now, Zoom Info costs a fortune. Yeah. Yeah, trust me, I know. I paid for my own Zoom Info license back in the day. But I would say, yeah, we're not a fit for every team. And it sounds like you guys obviously have some, you know, pretty robust motions going on right now. I guess if there was one or two areas we could, from the sounds of it, we could lend a hand is one, if you wanted to like get the exact contact and contract, So you know through keywords phrases you know competitor info we can either you know scrape what we have internally or we can send out you know FOIA requests and like like bulk FOIA requests basically to every public you know entity in public service or public sector entity in the US And then you get like full visibility into the exact accounts that you want to target. We try to consolidate a lot of just the kind of mundane tooling, especially around like RFP write-ups. So we have like a part of our platform is like we help expedite that with like a compliance matrix and everything. Again, And we're not always a fit for every team, but that's exactly why we do these more like preliminary intro chats just to kind of share our lesser known methodology. And then from there, you know, maybe if it makes sense down the road, you have another potential provider in your back pocket. But yeah, up to you, Sean, would it be a ridiculous idea to kind of put a face to the name? Can you provide me like information on this before I jump on a call? Yeah. So I understand what it actually is and how it's different than what we're already using today. I'm like, I don't know if this benefits us. And I guess I don't really understand. I'm not seeing it. I'm not on in front of anything. So on the road. Yeah, no, for sure. I'll send you some info here as well. So you just kind of have it for your records. But versus like zoom info. Number one, we the only arena we play in is government and education. That's it. So we do one thing really, really well. And if you ask us for, you know, like health care or technology sectors, if they're not related to government and education, It's like outside of our wheelhouse. Um, but we not only give you like insights into those intense signals, like when contracts expire, renewal dates, how much they close for, we're able to show like line by line what your competitors and whatever, you know, uh, contracts are in place, like what those line items are in there as well. Um, so just more visibility. And then that way you can like personalize it. You can put like, we have AI that just personalizes that messaging, whether that's email or, you know, the proposal writeups. on our platform. So how about this? I mean, it sounds like obviously you're still on the phone, so it's somewhat relevant to what you guys are doing. How about I send you an email with a little propaganda, our website, and you can kind of do your due diligence on us. And then if you're not against it, I can set us up for like a brief intro call. You will meet the team here. And then from there, if there's any there, then we can figure out what... Yeah, I'd rather do it that way. I want to, obviously, you called me out of the blue. I actually was thinking it was a different from a different place. So, um, but yeah, why don't you send me that? I'll definitely take a look at it and see what you guys are offering. It's not just after the fact you're, you're, you're building, you're, you're finding our events.  Exactly. Yeah. We call it the late to the- We'd find out afterwards. Or you said we could find out our competitors after the fact, what they did and everything like that. But you're also finding the opportunities beforehand. The problem with it is we're probably about seven verticals. And the ones we play the most in are healthcare, bio, pharma, then it's education, government, industrial. Those are our main. A little bit of food and beverage. hotel, a little bit of hospitality. But for the most part, those are our verticals. But government education aren't at the top either. Are you guys looking to expand into those verticals? Or are you kind of happy with the kind of makeup, your portfolio makeup? Well, we're never going to turn it down. I would say where we're trying to grow is in the healthcare space. But we'll obviously never turn down any type of government or higher education. Some of our top accounts are in the education space. So like John's up in University of Maryland. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. It definitely sounds like it's worth connecting over then. So let's see the email I had on file. Let's see if it's still the right one. I got s.com. Is that still a good one? Okay. I'll send over two emails. One will be the one pager and then I'll also send over like a calendar link. That way our schedules align. Are you operating out of Eastern time? That's correct. So for Eastern time, we have a 1.30 tomorrow as well as a 4.30 on Friday. It definitely won't be tomorrow. And you said it's a calendar. Yeah, calendar. I can choose. Yeah. They just have me pencil in a time. And then if you're double booked, then you can propose a new one if that works for you. Well, it's not going to be either of those two times. I'm in meetings all day tomorrow and 4.30 is later than I would want to meet on a Friday. Probably on a golf course or something. For sure. Friday afternoon, I tend to find myself with green grass under my feet. Yeah, I'm with you on that front. Okay, next Tuesday is a little more open. We have a 1230. Oh, actually, we can squeeze in at 930, 1230. And then a two and a three. If you have a preference. What's that date? The 23rd. Monday and Tuesday and golf tournament. Funny that I just said Friday I play, but that's funny. What do you have? Do you have anything on that Wednesday? 24th Wednesday. We have a couple 1030, 12, 3 and 330 Eastern Standard. Yep. Let's do 12. 12. Okay. Yeah, we'll shoot for then. Sean, if you want to do me a favor, feel free to hit accept the calendar link come through that way I know I didn fat finger anything Yeah If you have any other like thoughts or you want to focus in on kind of bring them to the chat But yeah it be good for you to meet the team I think you like folks over here you know just another resource in your back pocket All right, cool. Yeah, I'll take a look at that. I'll take a look at your website and the one page you're gonna send me. Okay. All right. Sounds good. We'll appreciate the time here. Thank you. And look forward to chatting next Wednesday. Have fun golfing. All right. Thanks. All right. All right. So we'll go ahead and book that meeting and then meeting scheduled for nine 24, 2025 at, what do we say? Noon, is that Eastern? 9, 10, 11, 12, 12 Eastern. Eastern time, receive. Okay, so after a quick rundown, we started asking questions about how we work, especially in relation to Zoom info and other data providers. Deeper visibility into RFPs. He agreed to receive some info this Tuesday. All right, nice. So we'll go ahead and we can post this deal. Number five on the day. And meeting and send this, this, this 12 minutes, 13 minutes. All right. And then advisor star bridge, add attachment, one pager info on Sean, Sean, here's some info on star bridge. All right. Send and resume dialing. Easy peasy, easy peasy. Speed run. Let's go. All right. kind of all right that last one ellie felt really good alexis alexis felt good hey sophie yeah hey sophie it's micah over at starbridge i know i'm catching out the blue here but i guess do you mind if i grab half a minute i'll tell you why i called and let me know if it's relevant or not okay appreciate that before i get ahead of myself do you guys sell into government or education accounts like sled accounts at all sometimes but it's not everything that's what you've over in depth you said it's like not like a huge priority for you guys no okay got it i don't want to eat up too much of your time. We do data intelligence, like sales intelligence, specifically for folks selling into the public sector. That's probably not the best for us. Okay. All right. No worries then, Sophie. Well, yeah, I'll let you get back to it then. Sounds good. Have a good one. All right. You as well. Take care. Bye-bye. Instant gunshot detection. This sounds like they should be selling into SLED. Gunshot detection. This is a small company though. Okay. Sophie says they They don't sell much into SLED accounts. That's weird. All right let see how we doing so far Almost four hours on the dialer not too bad Okay so this is really fascinating out of the 31 pickups 17 are either bad data convos or convo wrong ICP So 17 out of 31 54 of the people I talking with are just not closable whatsoever. I guess it's potentially difficult. I don't know how difficult it is to only have a list of companies that sell into SLED. That might be relatively difficult to figure out because it's like they only sell into SLED. You're already, Oh, hey, Jim. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Hey, Jim. It's Micah over at Starbridge. I know I'm catching out of the blue here, but I guess do you mind if I grab half a minute? I'll tell you why. What's Starbridge? Yeah, Starbridge. Does that name ring a bell by the off chance? No, it doesn't. Okay, no worries. Oh, yeah. Let me do this quick 10-second thumbnail. And if it's not relevant, just cut me off. But Starbridge, we are a go-to-market intelligence platform built specifically for folks selling into the public sector. And so what we're seeing from a high level is that, you know, more than 80% of RFPs are pre-written for a selected vendor. So the- Hey man, I retired June the 30th. Oh, nice. Congratulations. All right. See ya. Okay. Bad data. Retired. The majority. Hey, Jetson? Yes. Yeah. Hey, Jetson. It's Micah over at Starbridge. I know I'm catching on the blue here, but I guess do you mind if I grab half a minute? I'll tell you why I called and you can let me know if it's relevant or not. Yeah. Okay. Appreciate that. Just so I don't waste your time. Do you guys sell into government or education accounts, like sled accounts at all? Um, at Hayden Club? Oh, shoot. I had you at... Yeah, no, I'm no longer with... Oh, gotcha. Okay. Yeah, then maybe it wouldn't be as relevant to what you're doing. I know Robert Satterjee does. I do a lot of work, government and, you know, the military. So I can definitely get you a point of contact if you need it. Yeah, actually, that'd be super helpful. His name's Eric. Sorry, you cut out there. Go ahead again. His name is Eric. Okay. Phone number is 4139. Okay, cool. Well, I'll give Eric a shout out here. And yeah, appreciate the help. Yes, sir. Okay. Thanks, Judson. Take care now. All right, bye-bye. Easy peasy. We will take it. I'll take a referral. All right. So this one is bad data. Judson is no longer at energy. Let's say Judson referred Eric. Right. And then we're going to make this the primary lead. I will call this as a one-off. Eric should be here. All right. Good afternoon, this is Eric. Hey good afternoon Eric It Micah over at Starbridge Our mutual connection Jetson told me to darken your door I blame him for the interruption But do you mind if I grab half a minute here I tell you why I called and you let me know if it relevant or not Yeah, for sure. Okay. Appreciate that. Yeah, I'm not sure if he mentioned anything, but does the name Starbridge ring a bell just by the off chance? It does not. Okay. No worries. Well, yeah, let me do this quick 10 second thumbnail. Feel free to stop me if it's not relevant. Yeah. At Starbridge, we are a go-to-market intelligence platform built specifically for folks selling into the public sector. And so what we're seeing from a high level is that more than 80% of RFPs are pre-written for a selected vendor. The big question is, you know, is it possible to get in front of every one of your target agencies or schools, if you're going after K-12, before you get lost in the stack of generic proposal? And so to cut to it, our breakthrough lies in our AI-driven ability to surface every single intent signal through board meeting minutes, strategic plans, and even grant approvals. And we do it in a way where you can see line by line what your competitors are selling, who they're selling to, and when their contracts expire, which is pretty bananas in this space. Yeah, super simple, Eric. You know, my timing's probably off here. And obviously, I'm sure you have some tooling in place for something like this already. but that's exactly why we've been hosting the 15-minute Zoom screen shares, if you will, just to showcase the dashboards and AI in action. And then from there, you know, maybe keep us in the back pocket for down the road. Would you be game to loop up, say, tomorrow afternoon? I could probably do that tomorrow afternoon. Okay, let's see. Are you operating out of Eastern Time? Yeah, Eastern Standard. Yeah. Eastern Standard. How's your 1.30 looking? 1.30 is fine for me. Okay, sweet. I'll make it easy on you. I'll send you an email calendar invite. That way our schedules align. So I got Eric. And what is the best email to send this to? So it's e.com. Okay, sweet. Boop, boop, boop. All right. Just sent it over to you. So yeah, whenever you see it pop up in your inbox, it'll be a Calendly link. Feel free to hit accept. That way I know I didn't fat finger anything. And then one thing we do ask, I know, you know, meetings and fires can pop up out of the blue. Totally fine. What's the best way for you to let us know? I can just email if you're sending me the invite that way. I can send the email back if I won't be able to make it. Okay. Yeah, that works for us. I know some folks like to, you know, either text back or, or call back. Okay, sweet. And then last thing, and then I'll cut you loose here just so we can keep the chat short and sweet. Obviously, Jetson mentioned you guys have sold to the government. You have like defense contracts as well. What would you say sort of the biggest bottleneck holding you guys from like going after these slight accounts?  I think it's more just like access to all of the RFPs and being able to submit them in a timely manner just because there's so many of them and they run through. Everyone runs through a different hosting platform. So just being able to actually have access to them and get them all in is probably the biggest hurdle. Okay. It's definitely something we help folks punch above their weight class in. And then is there anyone else you want to loop in that typically kind of kicks the tires on these things with you? No, I actually pretty much handle all of it myself. We can keep it with me. It'll be fine. Okay, sweet. Yeah. Yeah, then we can keep it focused on kind of what you're seeing on the front lines. Anything else you have for me before I catch a loose here? No, I think I'm good. Okay. Well, yeah, appreciate the time here, Eric. And then look forward to chatting tomorrow. Awesome. I appreciate it. Okay. Thanks, Eric. Take care now. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. And we did it. Let's go. All right. We accomplished our goal of booking every single available time that was on the calendar tomorrow. Oh, baby. I don't even know what to say. Other than... We're getting paid. We're getting paid. All right. At 9.17, 20, 25 at 1.30 PM Eastern time. Eric was a mutual connection. Success to RPs. All right, let's go. Let's post the deal. I mean, there's reps on Starbridge. No one wants to see it. I'll take all of them. Joseph no longer at Robertson. Oh, another great example of a deal that the person on file was wrong. I got the referral. I connected with the referral and found the deal. That's really the name of the game. Pass, pass the ball. Boom. Assist. Shout out to Jetson. Shout out to Jetson. My man, my freaking man. Let's keep it going. Let's keep it going. People ask me all the time, Micah, what is the art of the possible? I will show you what is the art of the possible. This challenge turned from speed running cold calls till I make a thousand dollars into watch me book 10 sales meetings in 10 hours. All right. Come on, guys. Come on guys. What are we doing here? Is anyone working Is this thing on I want to see the reps in RSN crack 10K a month every month That what i want to see that my vision our mission statement is like helping a million sales reps make a hundred thousand dollars in sales through training events placement oh hey leah hey yeah hey leah it's micah over at star bridge i know i'm catching on the blue here but i guess do you mind if i grab half a minute i'll I'll tell you why I called and you can let me know if it's relevant or not. Okay. Okay. Appreciate that. Just to make sure I don't waste your time. Do you guys sell into government or education accounts, like sled accounts at all? Do we, I'm sorry, what was your question? Do we sign into them? Yeah. Do you like target for your customers? Do you ever do like government bids, government contracts, or like, do you sell to like K-12, higher education at all? Yes. We're usually a consultant though. You're usually a consultant. Okay. So. Yeah. On like an architect, an architect will hold the contract with one of the government agencies. Okay. So we're under. Oh, go ahead. We're under the architect usually. That makes sense. Well, yeah, let me do this. I'll give you the quick 10 second rundown and then just cut me off at any point if it's not relevant. But quick thumbnail on us. Starbridge, we are a go to market intelligence platform built specifically for folks selling into the public sector. And so what we're seeing from a high level is that more than 80% of RFPs are pre-written for a selected vendor. The big question is, you know, is it possible to get in front of every one of your target agencies or schools, you know, if you're going after higher ed before you get lost in the stack of generic proposal? And so to cut to it, our breakthrough lies in our AI driven ability to surface every single intent signal through board meeting minutes, strategic plans, and even grant approvals and doing it in a way where you can see line by line what your competitors are selling, who they're selling to, and when their contracts expire. Pretty bananas in this space. But super simple. Oh, go ahead. We already have a contract with FEC, and I'm not sure when we renew that, if it was recently renewed. I feel like my renewal date is sometime in January, but I'm not sure if it's upcoming or if it's the fall when we usually do two-year contracts. That would be a competitor, correct? Am I? Their GovWin is, I mean, that's kind of like, I'm sorry, sourcing platform. Is this what you do? Is that correct? Yeah, no, this is pretty similar. Find and win government contracts with analyst insights. Yeah, there could definitely be some overlap. Definitely don't want to rip and replace, especially if it's working well for you guys. I do know a lot of folks like to do sort of these like apples to apples comparisons just because we have you know we kind of sort of that new wave of AI capability Don want to waste your time Would it be a ridiculous idea to kind of share our capabilities and then from there maybe keep us in the back pocket for the renewal time? Yeah, that's fine. I don't have any time this week, but maybe the following week. Let me see what we've got. Pretty slammed for us for Tuesday. We've got a 930, a 1230, a two and a three. What do you do Tuesday at 3? Tuesday at 3? Okay, sweet. I'll make it easy on you, Leah. I'll send email calendar invite. That way our schedules align. And then if you have any like meetings or fires that pop up, then you can kind of propose a new time through that invite if that works for you. Okay. Would you mind sending me in your website and if you have a schedule of fees or different packages that I find it easier if I have all my options and I kind of kind of look what you guys offer. I know that that kind of stuff's not always set in stone, just so I have an idea of where we would potentially plug into. We're a small firm. We're less than 50 people. Gotcha. Okay. How many folks do you have like on the proposal and sort of sales and marketing team there? Me. It's just you. Yes. Holy smokes. Okay. Thank you for saying that. I feel validated. God bless your soul. Thank you. Yeah. I'll definitely send some info over as well. I think I'm personally not authorized to give like price sheets, but let me see if I can have my director give, send something over in advance. Did I ask what's the best email already? It's l.net. Okay, sweet. So that looks good. Well, I just hit send. So yeah, whenever you see that Calendly link pop up, feel free to hit accept. That way I know I didn't fat finger anything. Oh, is there anyone else you want to loop in or do you want to fly solo for this first one? I'll fly solo for this first one. Okay, cool. Okay, Leah, I think that's just about everything I have for you. Anything else you have for me before I cut you loose here? I don't think so. Okay. Appreciate the call. Yeah, yeah. I appreciate the time here and I'll get all the info sent over. If I can't get it, my director, Zach, it looks like that's going to you'll be meeting with. Yeah. He might need more info for like the pricing sheet. Worst case, we'll have something for you on the all on Tuesday. Okay, perfect. All right. Well, appreciate the time. Have a great rest of your week here. You too. Thank you. Okay, thanks. Take care. Bye bye. Boom. And another one. We're on easy mode. People are going to say it's not real. This guy's capping. This is bananas. Okay. at 3 p.m. Eastern time. Leah was not familiar with Starbridge and their sweet spot is K 12 and higher education All right let go Nothing to see here. Just a number eight on the day as a team. All right. I mean, what else are we going to do? I guess just keep it going. I guess we just, we just dial until we get paid. Is that what this speed run is dial until we get paid? Just won't stop dialing. Right. Let's do a quick check-in. We have four hours and 43 minutes on the dialer, 41 pickup, 14 conversations with the right ICP, and six booked meetings. So that means six divided by 14. That means we're converting 42% of every conversation with the right person. And, oh, hey, Jody. Hello. Who's this? Yeah. Hey, Jody. It's Micah over at Starbridge. I know I'm catching on the blue here, but I guess do you mind if I grab half a minute? I'll tell you why I called and you can let me know if it's relevant or not. Okay. Okay. Appreciate that. Just to make sure I'm not wasting your time. Do you guys sell into government or education accounts like SLED? Tell me what your company is and then we'll go from there. Yeah, yeah, for sure. I'll give you the 10 second thumbnail version. And what's the name of the company? Starbridge AI, if you want to check us out. But in a nutshell, we are a go-to-market intelligence platform built specifically for folks selling into the public sector. Okay. Yeah. No, not for us. Oh, gotcha. Okay. Sorry, But thank you. Yeah, for sure. You guys don't sell into schools or like a government agencies, municipal. No, not at the moment. I don't know what our future will bring, but not right now. No. Okay. All right. No worries. Thank you. Yeah. Okay. Take care. All right. Bye bye. Interesting. Jody, they do not sell into sled. Oh, hey, Burke. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Hey Burke. It's a Micah over at a star bridge. I know I'm catching out of the blue here, but I guess do you mind if I grab half a minute? I'll tell you why I called and you can let me know if it's relevant or not. Okay. Okay. Appreciate that. So, and then just to make sure I don't waste your time. Do you guys sell into government or education accounts, like slight accounts at all? You mean for the company that I work for? Yeah, exactly. Yes. We have a full government strike force. Okay. Got you. So yeah, this should be in your wheelhouse, but yeah, cut me off at any point if it's not. So quick thumbnail on us. Starbridge. We are a go-to-market intelligence platform built specifically for folks selling into the public sector. And so what we're seeing from a high level is that more than 80% of RFPs are pre-written for a selected vendor already. So the big thing.  question is, is it possible to get in front of every one of your target agencies or schools, if you're targeting K-12, before you get lost in the stack of generic proposals? And so to cut to it, our break- Starting Rob, when you say K-12, you mean K-12? K-12, yeah, excuse me, higher education. Yeah, I'm not even involved in that. I'm dealing with like university accounts, specifically deal in surgical residency programs for what I do for a living. Oh, nice. Okay. We definitely help with universities as well as long as they're you know like like government funded so maybe I can kind of cut to it you know sort of our breakthrough is in our ability to surface every single intent signal through you know think board meeting minutes strategic plans and even grant approvals and we do it in a way where you can see line by line what your competitors are selling who they're selling to and when their contracts expire so it's pretty bananas for you know, for this space. But super simple here, Burke, you know, I don't want to overstay my welcome. And, you know, obviously, we're not a fit for every team. But that's exactly why we've been hosting these like 15 minute zoom screen shares, if you will, just to showcase the dashboards and AI in action. And then from there, you know, maybe keep us in the back pocket for for down the road. Yeah, well, in the dental business, there's only 46 dental universities in North America that we work with. And we have a contract with every single one of them that expands our entire portfolio. So So the one thing about our business, we're kind of unique in dental and we have really our dental school really kind of training on everything that we make. I mean, it's a very lucrative and profitable platform that we're in. So we're just not seeking any help for it. We don't really need it. If we make it, they use it and they need us to do the training. So it's really kind of like a lockdown program. But I just don't think we're a fit. But I wanted to hear you out because, I mean, I'm in sales and I understand, you know, you're trying to find the right niche. And I get that. So I wanted to give you that. But I just don't think that we're a good fit from what I do. No, for sure. Yeah. Appreciate the candor. No, you got it. You got it. I wish the best of luck to you finding the right candidate. I think it sounds like you have a neat product. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. I feel like in a lot of ways, we're kind of taking this this vertical by storm. We're at like all the trade shows and we've had some pretty good successes with sort of our outreach. You know, sometimes we miss the mark, like in this case, but because it's sometimes it's a little fuzzy. Like yes you work with the with government or SLED But like you said you know it more of a I don know what would you say Like uncommon model Yeah Yeah Yeah But many of the deans said on our board it a it kind of it a good thing but I appreciate your time. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. All right, Burke. Well, I'll let you go back to it. All right. Take care. All right. Okay. Bye-bye. All right. Not relevant persona. He's a decision maker, but I'm just going to say not relevant. Oh, hey, Jack. You have the wrong number. Oh, shoot. Sorry about that. Did I call the, the Pete store? please leave your message for three four seven so he corrected me i think he's a k through 12 k through oh hey chad uh who is this oh yeah hey chad it's uh micah um over at starbridge um you know i know i'm catching out the blue here but i guess do you mind if i grab uh half a minute i'll tell you why i called and you can let me know if it's relevant or not well if it's a sales call it's probably not relevant so because i'm not in the market for anything oh but you take me off the the list. Thanks. Interesting. Do not call requested DNC. Please leave your message for 571. All right, let's see if we can get lucky number seven. And then I do have a hard stop at 3 30 so i'll probably pop off oh hey sarah hello hello and oh hey uh johanna yeah oh yeah hey joanna it's uh micah um over at starbridge um you know i know i'm catching out the blue here but i guess you mind if i grab uh half a minute i'll tell you why i called and you can let me know if it's relevant or not okay appreciate that just to make sure i'm not wasting your time do you guys sell into like government or educational accounts or like like sled accounts at all um no i i think i actually talked to a colleague i don't forget if it was you honestly um maybe two or three months ago it's and we concluded that this was not a fit um we don't sell into those organizations no gotcha okay because yeah i'm looking at your linkedin here because you guys do obviously do construction But you're not building it all for like schools or universities, like cities or state agencies at all? No, we do some of that, but it's usually through private clients. We don't work a lot through municipalities directly now, at least in our region. Yeah. I mean other regions might and that wouldn be the Dayton area So yeah and the federal work that we do with government contracts is done through the Corps of Engineers So we don't feel like we need any leave or anything for that. Makes sense. Okay. All right. No worries. Well, yeah, that makes this call a little easier. So I'll mark you down so we don't keep bugging you. But outside of that, I'll let you get back to it here. All right. Awesome. Thanks. Have a good evening. All right. You as well. Take care. Thanks. Bye. All right. Bye. All right. Not relevant persona. Uh, don't sell to SLED. Oh, hey, Jamie. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Hey, Jamie. It's Micah over at Starbridge. I know I'm catching out of the blue here, but I guess do you mind if I grab half a minute? I'll tell you why I called and you can let me know if it's relevant or not. Um, sure. Okay. Appreciate that. So I don't want to waste your time. Do you guys sell to like government or educational accounts like SLED at all? I believe so. Okay. Okay. Um, well, this should be relevant, but, uh, feel free to cut me off at any point if it's not. Um, but yeah, quick thumbnail on us, uh, Starbridge, we are a go-to market intelligence platform built specifically for folks selling into the public sector. And so what, what we're seeing from a high level is that more than 80% of RFPs are pre written for a selected vendor. And so the big question is, you know, is it possible to get in front of every one of your target accounts, you know, maybe schools or agencies, depending on who you're going after, before you get lost in the stack of generic proposals. And so to cut to it, Jamie, you know, our breakthrough lies in our AI driven ability to surface every single intent signal through, you know, think board minute or board meeting minutes, strategic plans, and even grant approvals. And we do it in a way where you can see line by line what your competitors are selling, who they're selling to and when their contracts expire, which is pretty bananas in this space. But super simple. My timing's probably off here. And I know you and the folks probably have some, you know, similar tooling like this in place already. But that's exactly why we've been hosting these 15 minute Zoom screen shares, if you will, just to showcase the dashboards and AI in action. And then from there, you know, maybe keep us in the back pocket for for down the road. So yeah, will you be game to loop up, say, maybe next Tuesday. So I don't make those decisions. That's my director of sales. So she when workflow, I guess we're an hour behind you. Is it four o'clock in Texas? It is about three o'clock. This is my line. I actually here in Phoenix Phoenix Arizona OK so it six about six o here So we are closed for the day So she would be able to make those decisions I do not I do service portion Do you mind like emailing into an email address I provide to you? Yeah, sure. All right. It is info at dot com. Okay, sweet. And then what was your director's name? Amanda. Amanda. Okay. So Amanda would be more apt to look at something like this if there's even a room for me. Correct. Yes. Okay. Gotcha. Okay. Yeah. Well, I'll send a note to that email and I'm assuming it's just like a general one, like shared, shared email for visit. Yes, it is. But she'll be on there so she can respond if she is interested. Yeah. You probably won't get a response until tomorrow morning and we open back up at 8am Eastern time. So you'll probably, if she wants to do that, she'll reach out sometime after we open up. Okay. Yeah. Sounds good and then is it or same person um was her married name and it's her maiden name so she went back to the maiden name okay gotcha okay yeah that makes sense um okay cool yeah well yeah i will uh send a note here and then i will go from there all right sounds good okay thanks jamie thank you all right bye-bye all right not relevant persona we can end it there let's get one more conversation but I'm going to start compiling stats while we we dial here. So we're going to go 742 50 742 book rate. We'll do book rate off of how about conversations. So six please leave your message for seven seven or true book rate six out of 16. Bad data poor source. So 12 plus 17 equals 29 divided by pickups 50 she calls show rate we'll see we'll see at the tone please record your message when you have finished recording you may hang up or press one for more options all right so training time training time was like 1.5 hours and then our dial time five hours 51 minutes that's five divided by six 7 20 a.m when we started that's probably about an hour and a half of of training time. We'll just round up. How about that? Just keep it easy. 7.5 hours of total work time. 50 divided by 742 is 6.7%. 742 divided by 50. It's about 15 to one. That's actually really good. All right. Six divided by 33 is 18%. And.  leave your message for all right we will call it here because otherwise it's going to keep running up my stats so we're going to go here dial 770 so that means 50 divided by 770 6.5 percent or it's like 15.4 so and just say 15 to 1 true booked rate was 37.5 37.5 percent bad data rate 29 divided by 50 58 show rate and then all that okay so let's walk through the stats today's dial session we took about an hour and a half to do the training our dial time was just under six hours which means total work time is seven and a half hours however many deals come in we'll divide that by 7.5 we were shooting for at least a three percent pickup rate we're more than double that 6.5 or 15 to 1 dial to pick up which is really really strong we were aiming for at least a five percent book rate really above 10. And if we're going based off of conversations, so we'll say all convos, out of all convos, we converted six out of 33, which is an 18% clip. That's pretty good. But of the true conversations with the right ICP, it was actually six out of 16, which is a 37.5% conversion rate. We're in business for sure. We were hoping for a bad data rate of less than 40%. And that's bad data plus wrong ICP. These are actually two separate issues. So if it's bad data, you just have a poor provider or scraping tool. It's outdated sources. If it's the wrong ICP, that's actually a targeting issue. In this case, it is going to be fuzzy if a company actually sells to state, local, and education. And it's just not like if you listen back to some of the conversations, some of them were just like, we work with universities, but in a different way than you're thinking. 58% were just not closable. It's actually not that bad though, because really the bad data rate was closer to 24%. It's workable. One in four are just the wrong person altogether. It's not amazing, but definitely workable. And obviously when we got in front of the right person, they would convert. Yeah. We'll come back tomorrow to do the warm handoffs and to make sure that these prospects show. And then once one of those deals gets paid out, then we'll conclude our speed run. So we'll see you on the warm handoff here. All right. It's the very next day and we are going to do a warm handoff So let jump into that link to join meeting Okay In progress All right Hey how it going good morning how everyone doing we good doing good i am also at a conference it looks like you might be yes i am i am what conference are you at i'm at a parks and rec conference in orlando what about you yeah facility management conference in minneapolis okay yes wait i heard about this one it seems like a good one it's like a show for facilities right yeah totally totally it's called ifma yeah i was talking to crowd comp i'm not sure if you're familiar with that company i think they're there they do like cleaning janitorial software that you know like as part of your asset management for facilities it's like specific to the janitorial side i guess very cool yeah but hey i appreciate you taking the time out of the conference to learn about our bridge yes you too tell me a little bit about the sales motion today and how you guys are developing new business? Like, is it E's? Is it what's the kind of mix that y'all are doing today? So we, I mean, we're headquartered in Denver and we are national. So we have, I think eight or nine other areas that we're servicing. We're 20 states right now. Our sales team is seven people. So we're all outside sales. Okay. We're in the field every day. We had an inside salesperson to kind of generate some leads for us. And he recently left. He's got grandkids in California. So he's left the company. But now we're kind of looking at, you know, what, what kind of platforms we can use for lead generation, you know, there's time out there. So we're kind of seeing, you know, what everyone has to offer. So it's a lot of organic growth right now, calling and hunting in that aspect. So trying to see what you guys have and how we can do some lead generation that way. Yeah, 100%. And you guys do all of the US or only focus on certain service areas? We do, most of the US. There are some states that we don't service. Like Idaho, for example, we don't have anybody there. I want to say like Georgia and some of those states, but like right now we're kind of focusing on like the Denver market. That makes sense. Okay, yeah, no, that makes total sense. Then what are you guys using today? Like are you using CRM? Do they have any email sequencing tools for the cold outbound? Like how do the reps do their day-to-day? Yeah, we don't have, I don't know if you've heard that. No, they're telling Zoom info. Okay. And then how much of your business would you say is focused on public sector versus commercial, like government, education, those kinds of entities? A lot. I don't have a percentage, but each market's different. You know, like we focus on different things, but for the Denver market, we do a lot of public sector work. Okay. Just throwing that out there because our platform is 100% public sector. So I wanted to make sure you're worth your time as you're looking at new tools. Yeah. Is it a big enough chunk of your business to dedicate a whole tool? Yeah, it is. And I will say though, like with how we're kind of operating in Denver is like, I do a a lot of the, I do mostly commercial private stuff. And then we do have a team that works on like RFPs and proposals for the public sector. Oh, okay, great. I happy to dive in and show you around so that you can get a good feel for the platform and how we can help generate those leads And then as we go through feel free to ask any questions yeah so if i go into our bridge you notice that everything we do is coming from these channels right so we have the rfp sourcing capability we have meetings intelligence what are they saying in their meetings and their strategic plans in their committee agendas anytime they're gathering we'll be able to pull in those assets just order data what are they spending in terms of you know janitorial services today yeah what are they what are they using who are they using so any competitive intel can be clean for purchase data contact so probably unlike what you're using today a lot of those horizontal providers like like a Zoom info, they are using LinkedIn as their primary data source. And we know in public sector, especially, they're really bad at updating their LinkedIn. The way we approach contact data, literally going out to those staff directory websites in public sector and scraping in real time all of that contact information. So it's the most up-to-date, accurate, reliable source of truth. And then we can also do forward-looking web signals to keep you in loop as changes are happening. So like if you wanted to know anytime there was a new director of facilities at your target accounts or a new superintendent in K-12 or something like that, we can do job change alerts. We can also do grant funding. Let's say they get a huge capital improvement plan, budget approved. they're going to need extended cleaning facilities for new contract, new vendors. So we can do that by looking on a cadence of your choosing. Like every two months, we'll pull in all of those new job changes, things like that. Sorry to interrupt, but are you looking at just public schools or do you do any charter schools? Yeah, we can do charter schools for sure. The only thing that would be limited to public schools is the purchase data because charter schools don't have to share any of their purchase records. They're not pulled into public records requests or Freedom of Information Act because they're private. And then similarly, they don't have to post board meeting minutes, but they often do post strategic plans. And we can use the web scraping for charter schools. It's pretty amazing what you can get from just the web agent on the private. Yeah. So what this looks like in practice. So we can take, let's say, a state and a segment of accounts. So I took a mix of different schools in New Jersey, for instance. We can pull in things like, what is the path to procurement here? Are they part of any co-ops like Source12, Omnia, et cetera, that you know the best way to work with every single public sector entity. And then we can layer over those things like job changes, like, oh, there's a new director of infrastructure and operations as of September 1st. So that's good. They're probably doing something in that space. You know, here are new assistant superintendent, et cetera. we can also pull in interesting things like what's their deferred maintenance total so in their budget line items how much is deferred maintenance so you know like okay they're putting a lot of things off they're going to need a lot of help in terms of you know cleaning janitorial etc similarly we can do a sweep competition so you know are they using a facilities maybe it's not competition in your sense but it'll show an indicator of spending money like are they using an fmx of rightly you know upkeep incident iq are they using any of these platforms that cost a fair amount of money to show that they're actually invested in facilities and then of course like who is their facilities leader today okay superintendent this whole kind of thing can can be replicated across state agencies, local cities, government entities, as well as higher education, if you guys do colleges and universities too. They think about all of your accounts, having all of this information at your fingertips and then you can even assign a score like hey if they have a facilities leader they have a platform for facilities asset management that they spending a significant amount of money on they gone to rfp in the past three years for janitorial services and i don know they this much enrollment so you know it a big job sort of a five because they really worth us hunting and going after if they don't have those things probably not worth us prioritizing them with small team so you can layer a scoring system over these data points so that your reps know like okay i need to target these accounts in my territory because they're the warmest and will probably open the door okay okay cool well this was really informative and helpful so thank you for kind of walking through all that yeah how are you thinking about the evaluations you guys have have like a timeline in mind just so I can be helpful in prioritizing. Honestly, I am not sure about the timeline. I know that we're kind of looking at this stuff now. I'm sure like, you know, beginning of next year is probably a good target to kind of implement, you know, a new platform. So what do you like next steps look like on your end? Depending on your internal process of how you guys evaluate, we could do a larger demo with the other stakeholders that are weighing in on this decision, something more customized, pure use case, or I'm happy to just provide like materials and reporting from today and you load it, see where it goes. It's totally up to you. Yeah. Okay. Well, why don't we do that? So you want to send me like some materials and then I can talk to my boss and kind of gauge, you know, what our priorities are, then we can cut it from Yeah, I think that sounds great. Cool. We'll have an amazing rest of the conference. Hope it's a good night for you guys. Thank you. Yeah, totally. All right. Well, thanks so much again. I appreciate it. Nice meeting you. You too. Bye bye. All right. That seemed like a productive meeting. My thoughts on that. It looks like it should have been pre-qualified because her title was business development manager. But every so often you get sometimes companies will make biz dev manager like they're actually just an individual contributor and they don't actually manage anything. So in that case, we'll see where that one lands. Other thoughts on that one. I could get dinged. So if I pull out my screen here, I could get dinged on that. She doesn't necessarily handle. I think she said she was commercial private sector, but she knows like there's people on the teams on her team that handles sled and the RFPs. So that could be one. I could potentially get dinged on, you know, not having an exact timeline, but she said early next year also sounded like she might have been looking at legion tools instead of just like a data tool so we'll see what the overlap there is i'll probably dispute if this one doesn't get qualified sooner rather than later obviously nicole's at the conference and we have a couple more set to show later today but i'll probably dispute this one i think there's some good grounds if it doesn't come back as qualified there's a world that just comes back as qualified so We will see what happens there. And I'll give an update as soon as I get some intel on that. I don't think we need to do any more dialing for this speed run. I'll probably just cut to the next qualified show, which is at 9 a.m. my time, and it is currently 7.  28. It's just a waiting game now for these deals to get qualified. Okay, we've got our next warm handoff coming up here at 9am. This one is Kyle. We will hop on that shortly here. Recording in progress. Hey, what's going on, Zach? So Micah, how are we doing? Doing good. Doing good. How are you? I love the setup. Office looks sick. Thanks. Appreciate it. Where are you based out of? I'm here in Phoenix, Phoenix, Arizona. I was the one that got this coordinated with Kyle here. Let me know if he pops into the waiting room. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. How are you? How are you? I'm sorry. I don't have a camera. It's all good. It's all right. Hey, I know the customer was holding me hostage there for a second, so a little behind the gun, but definitely want to make best use of our time here. Kyle meet Zach. Zach meet Kyle. Zach is my director here, who will be able to share a little bit about what we talked about yesterday. I think Zach had a few questions just around like, you know, who you guys are specifically targeting. And then I've also relayed some of the info of like how Christian laughed and how you're kind of filling in. and kind of wearing multiple hats here. But I'll turn it over to Zach to share the high level and then ask the right questions as well. Yeah. Thanks, Micah. Nice to meet you, Kyle. Appreciate you. I'm Zach. Obviously, I help lead sales efforts here at Starbridge. I would love to get an understanding, you know, I've gotten some notes from Mike, but like would love to understand, you know, I know you had guys that talked about like bids and RFPs, but like specifically what got you interested in like learning more about Starbridge is if there's like anything going on in the business that's like bringing this type of concept top of mind? So something I'm trying to do is get into like fire departments just to get bored of fire mitigation, cleaning jobs, things of that nature. I'm trying to get in with like hotels for water damage, police departments for like biohazard cleanup. But I know that they all have like contracts with different vendors like Belfort or Surf Crow. I'm also trying to get in with like apartment complexes, property managers, things of that nature, anything that could potentially need like a remodel job or has like an emergency service job, like a flood, a sewage backup or a fire, or even something like mold. Just being able to be there, support them, give them a really good price and build like a working relationship with them. For sure. Yeah, I think that's a good place to start. And what are you doing right now to get in with these folks? How do you figure out like where you should be prioritizing your time? So Christian was our business development manager. So a lot of times he would be paying like a visit to these places like a brick and mortar shop for some places though like that he would be trying to go into they not necessarily like a client facing storefront or like the office is locked up and they kind of like run around and manage the properties all day so there some places that we have like trouble getting into but a lot of our efforts have been through like inside sales and then like outside direct sales have actually been dropping off information and things that make people want to call it back yeah like extreme measures when it comes to like the manual outbound approach yeah and then also things like paying a referral fee so like if we go out and see a plumber or we go out and see an hvac company hey if you give us a qualified lead we'll pay you 500 for it or if it's not qualified we'll give you 100 for mentioning our name and sending us out because it is still brand visibility. It's just not like a sale, if that makes sense. Totally. And how much of the business is actually selling to SLED? And when I say SLED, that's state, local education. When you're talking about property managers, HVAC companies, things like that, those aren't really going to fall under, or like hotels, brick and mortar, they're not going to fall under Starbridge. We assist in the niche of state, local and education. So if you have state, local accounts, like police departments, fire departments, or cities, municipalities, state agencies, we can tell you what's going on. But everything else that's private, privatized businesses, we don't have insight into. So what percentage would you would you say is actually selling to the public side? So to be honest with you, a lot. We want to be doing jobs. Like we're kind of, we just did a job for Northfield Township, Michigan. Their city hall had a flood, but they like got us through like elite generation. Like someone just Googled and the call kind of like came to us through like PPC, if you will, or PPL. So that's kind of like how we've been getting municipalities. I did fill out like a vendor packet for like Lansing's fire department. We did get one job from them, but I currently am not operating in Lansing, but I'd like to be able to kind of get my foot through the door easier. Like because when I got in with Lansing, my business development guy just happened to walk into the fire department three days before the contract expired. Okay. So knowing different cities, townships, do they have any challenges that you could help with? Or was there a recent natural disaster that they're talking about in a strategic meeting or board plan where you could provide that solution? And now you know exactly who to be reaching out to or who to be showing up to. Instead of being random, you're showing up at the right place because you know there's competition there. You know that they have initiatives. Exactly. So for me, my dad actually retired from the water department in the city that we're in, and he was head of the water department. It was funny to me that we worked in a similar industry, but he had a contract with a different company and not with me. But again, they were locked into a contract, then he retired, so he wasn't a decision maker anymore. But when there's a water main break or things of that nature in the water department, there are sewage backups in the homes, and then the city is technically responsible for it if they cause it. So that's where I'm trying to get in with municipalities and cities, townships, counties, anything like that. Because I mean, things like water departments don't happen. I mean, they can go out and check a water meter, it's super rusty, the line burst, and then the homeowner's like, hey, who do you refer? Well, even if they're just saying this has nothing to do with us, but call the company, that's where I'm trying to get in with them. For sure. I totally hear you. I guess it sounds like this is a major priority right now, like you guys breaking into more of the public sector, continue to grow that side of the business. Like, is this the top priority for 911 restoration right now? Yeah, so my biggest priority is getting into the fire department. Okay. Well, let me pull up an example for you, and we can show you how Starbridge will be able to help you prioritize your accounts, not just based off like ease, but also based off, you know, recent events, job changes, competitive Intel, right? Like, are they using a competitor of ours? Did they recently purchase solutions similar to ours that we could partner with right Like anything like that If you think about Starbridge we almost like the bionic ear to your market So there a haystack of fire departments across the United States You manually showing up you reaching out to people you trying to find those needles in the haystack to figure out where exactly are the best opportunities. That's where Starbridge can come in. We'll just give you the needle. We'll tell you, hey, these fire departments, they're talking about things that you can help with right now. Here's who you should be reaching out to and with what message. So I share my screen here. See my screen? Yeah. So we're tracking things like RFP bids, right? So you can track RFPs. We can't even tell you if they're a good fit using AI. We also have an AI proposal writer to get these bids built out a lot quicker. You can track meetings and strategic board plans. So cities, counties, fire departments, police departments, they're talking about things that you could potentially help with in any of those county meetings or strategic board plans. You could get an alert on that. We can make it actionable so you know exactly what to say. We can track purchase order data. So for competitive contracts, one of those things expiring, right? Getting insight into that. Fireless, if you want to look at, let's look at all the fire departments in Texas and tell me exactly which ones are a good fit, where we should be prioritizing our time, where we should be sending snacks to, right? Like that can be a huge insight for you to know, like where should we be putting our resources? Because we're going to have a higher likelihood to close the deal there. Or contactless, right? Like pulling all the fire chiefs in a certain state, right? And pushing that in your CRM so you you always have up-to-date contact information, or custom web signals around natural disasters, or sewage pipes breaking, or grants, or job changes, right? So they get a new fire chief, tracking all this information, and putting it into what we call a bridge, which is like an AI enriched lead list. So I'll show you a couple examples here real quick, because I know we only have eight more minutes. But in this example, I'm looking at 30 cities, which is randomly selected. You can look across your entire market here. And what I want to use Starbridge to do is help me understand where I should be prioritizing my time, and which cities or fire departments have the best fit for me. So using Starbridge, right? You can actually use new web agents to go out and search for specific information that's going to help you understand where I should be prioritizing my time. So right now, the example you gave, your business development person was showing up at random fire departments and then trying to figure out, is this a good fit? That's a ton of time and resources put out there and you're banking on getting lucky. So a lot of times I'm sure it's wasted because you show up and they're not interested or they use a competitor and they're locked in at the expense of there's a fire department, two counties over, that's literally talking about this exact challenge or solution that you can solve for. And so what we can do is we can do wide, very specific searches to pull in information that you want to help you understand where it should be prioritized. So in this example, we're looking at fire department modernization initiatives, we did a specific web agent search, it would be completely customized to you. Right? So in this example, we know that they're modernizing here, station replacements, apparatus renewals, et cetera, et cetera. Here's the reason behind it. Here's all the sources we pulled from. And now you have an idea scaled across all the fire departments in the United States. You know what they're modernizing, what the challenges are, how 911 can help them. We're looking at fire force growing, population growth in the area. Did they purchase any recent equipment that you guys might compete with? Do they have any competition in the space already? Right? Again, this is completely customized to whatever it is that you want to search for, right? Like we would build a custom search and then pull that information forward. So now you can see, okay, yeah, they just increased their SCBA inventory here. Here's all the sources, the reasoning. Was there any recent fire department grants or funding, right? FEMA, do they have any natural disasters? Any leadership changes we can pull in from another cross bridge Who their new chief What does their SCBA contract look like We can pull that in as well And then you can actually score your accounts Right So for me if I a biz dev I probably don want to focus on the city of Denver as much as Raleigh because they're a better fit. They've had a leadership change. They just fit our criteria a lot more. So you could use Starbridge to actually run a search and help you prioritize your time, ultimately making it super easy for you to be reaching out to the right fire departments at the right time with the right message. And then you're going to book way more meetings. You're going to know what their priorities are. And you're going to be closing more business in the first month of using storage. That makes sense. I like this. Yeah, how does this come here? What are you doing? Well, I apologize because I kind of got into this widely. I didn't know that our BDM was already talking to you guys. So I was very new to this, but now that I've seen it, this looks like it's going to save us quite a bit of time and energy and effort, like you said. This is something I could do inside sales too, like from here in the meantime, until I have somebody to actually go, but giving them this information is going to be extremely helpful. Yeah, I mean, some teams are using this as like their business development team, right? Like, so you know, for example, where we're tracking like warm signals in the last 30 days. So we can actually do a specific search around, you know, whatever it is that you're looking for. In this example, I'm looking at state agencies, cities, and counties, we get in police departments. And what I'm doing is actually searching for mentions related to SEBA replacement, firefighter safety equipment, PPA upgrade fire department, equipment purchase, right? Like anything that'd be relevant for you to know we can search for in the last 30 days. And we have over a hundred hot leads. I'll actually add in the date or I might already had it, but just to show you, right? Like we have a hundred hot leads where these cities are literally talking about like capital improvement programs for their fire department or engaging for carrying essential equipment for their fire department, right? Like we could do a specific search and then feed you these like inbound leads across all of these cities, you could run AI analysis to literally do like, Hey, review the meeting and tell us like exactly what the strategic initiative or challenges, what the staff staffing funding or growth initiatives are, who's the meeting contact that we should be reaching out to and then give you like email snippets, cool call scripts, whatever it is, that's going to help you book that meeting while knowing that this is like a super highly priority account because they're literally talking about things that you can help with. Yeah. Yeah. If you have any additional questions or need to see any additional things in the platform, like happy to walk through that through with you, but it sounds like that's a great, and I think, you know, taking advantage of the September incentives, it makes sense. If your owner also, you know, agrees that it might be cheaper to just use this than hire someone completely. one more question i have here and then i can let you go is there like a commitment like a contract or is this like yes annual agreement like if we were okay annual agreement so if we do we have to sign for you okay that's fine i just wanted to know what i was up against yes annual agreements you know i'm sure especially with the september things going on like it's still a 12-month agreement but we could talk about like giving up the price so if you want to do like a semi-annual or something like that we could probably work through and just have to get zero if we commit to pay for the year like can i pay quarterly or something like that you know to kind of alleviate a giant payment at a time yeah something like that where it's like you pay some up front and then we could do like you know yeah yeah even if we did like 50 down and then the rest we paid off quarterly or something like that. Yeah, you can figure something out like that out for sure. That's good to share with your owner, right? Like we understand, our whole mantra is to help teams that have less resources act like they have a ton. And so we understand the 15K upfront can be difficult. We're willing to work with you guys to be good partners, especially for good use cases. Okay, I like that.  i'm sorry my customer won't let me off the phone thank you for being a little late today and i appreciate all this information and i'm actually really excited to talk to him about that stuff cool awesome yeah i'll try to get that follow up over as soon as possible i gotta jump to another call here in the next seven minutes but yeah looking forward to working with you on this Kyle thanks all right thanks have a good day yeah see you guys all right okay that was that was a much better discovery call i think that's got to be that's got to be decent we've got some other stuff to do but we'll tune back in we'll come back around when that deal gets qualified otherwise i got two disputes in my hand but stand on top of it baby let's go all right and we got the deal qualified let's go it is now 10 a.m so it looks like that second deal that went through got qualified and it took a little less than what 40 minutes to get that one paid out so not too bad almost real time and then i'll pull up my stripe dashboard let's see if it came through on stripe so yep looks like it came through on stripe there it is september 17th 1050 dollars and stop the the clock that concludes our speed run I go over what I think went well and what I think we could have done better We put some of the stats on our page here Show rate was two for two which is 100 And then qualification rate right now it's at one for two, one for two or 50%. Again, yeah, so we'll go through the stats on the cold call bookings here. Again, training time was an hour and a half dial time was six hours so that's 7.5 hours and we made what a thousand fifty dollars so that is let me put the math together that's 140 an hour based on that one deal we still have one pending dispute and we have four other deals set to show so we could be making up to six grand And in seven and a half hours of work, I think that'd be like 61, two, three, 6,300 divided by 7.5. So potentially we could make upwards of like an hour but realistically two to three of those will pull through And then yeah I think we had a really good pickup rate really good book rate add data rate could be a little better but that just a targeting thing i'm assuming starbridge just scraped companies that have contracts with government entities so that's how they're kind of putting their list together which is actually pretty smart i think i could have qualified a little better so especially that first one i think if i drilled in i'm like are you the one that handles the sled accounts are you the end decision maker not or at least an influencer and then maybe do you guys have at least five sales folks that actively work on the sled team i think i need to get more specific with those qualification questions because there was a little ambiguity as you saw for the first handoff and even the second handoff the second handoff i think we got very fortunate that they're first and foremost targeting fire departments, but you watch it and it's like it wouldn't be inherently obvious that they work with government entities. So getting more clarification on that, that way the AE feels a little more prepared for those calls But other than that yeah just a really solid campaign One of the hottest ones on the Glencoe marketplace right now And a lot of folks are making some really good money on that one If you guys are looking to make some side income and leverage your cold calling skills on the Glen Coco marketplace, I think it's a great opportunity to, you know, work on your own schedule, work at your own pace, make money on a performance basis. And that's exactly what it will look like. And that's exactly what it'll feel like. So no, really, really solid. I would say that concludes our speed run and if you're still watching this congrats because this was a long one in this video obviously you saw my full process for cold calling everything i'm doing and how i'm actually talking on the phone with these prospects but there's a lot of advice i wanted to share that isn't really possible to share in a practical video like this which is why i made this video right here for you where i go over 27 of my absolute top most important lessons from thousands and thousands of cold calls made that you can apply to your own cold calls to see better results so whether you're cold calling for your own business or you know for someone else's just like i showed you in this video those tips will help you so i'll see you in the next one and thanks for watching",
